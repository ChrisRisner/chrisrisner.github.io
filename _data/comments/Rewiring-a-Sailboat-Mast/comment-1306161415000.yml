But his feelings do not make him so selfish, but he actually loves<br>sailing with us. A year ago, we changed the lights into something romantic,<br>once for his proposal to Kate (now his wife). It was the most romantic proposal<br>I have ever seen in my whole life. Never thought he is that dramatic and sweet.</p><p></p>"
