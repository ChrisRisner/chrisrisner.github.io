message: "<p>I spent the weekend and even Friday working on my boat. I got it out of storage on Friday and spent all afternoon cleaning the carpet in the boat. I literally had dead shrimp carcus baked into the carpet that didn't give it a pleasant look. After scrubbing on hands and knees every square inch of the carpet and rinsing the soap out best I could I got the dry vac out and vacuumed the water and dirt out. You can pretty much eat off the carpet now. I also cleaned out some storage compartments while I had the dry vac onboard. Then yesterday I washed and waxed it and put 303 protectant on everything. She's looking mighty slick now.</p>"
