message: "<p>Hi Guillaume,<br>If I recall correctly, I just put in the comment ID I had in my original database.  If that's the case, you should be able to put in any IDs you want. I would go through the (also painful) process of making up IDs and then figuring out where to put the appropriate parent ID.  I imagine jcomments has some method of tracking what's attached as a reply so I'd think you could script it to add IDs for each one and a parent where appropriate.  Hope that helps.<br>Chris</p>"
