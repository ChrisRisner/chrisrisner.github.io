message: "<p>Wow, this really helped me out. Thank you for documenting the problems you ran into and how you solved them. As you know, when something goes wrong with the Disqus import you have no way of knowing what went wrong and how to fix it. The documentation and support are not very useful for this.</p><p>I don't think this information is available anywhere else on the internet! I wish I would have found this earlier.</p>"
