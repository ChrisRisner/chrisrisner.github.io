message: "<p>Hey ! I just installed Disqus on my <a href=\"http://www.resultplanet.in\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"http://www.resultplanet.in\">http://www.resultplanet.in</a> site; but i'm fairly disappointed to see that Disqus doesn't recognize my old comments : all my older comments are marked as posted by a guest. Did I miss a step ? Is there a way to have my old comments linked to my Disqus profile ? (my Disqus user mail is the exact same as my wordpress admin-user email, I would have thought it would have been automaticly recognized).</p>"
