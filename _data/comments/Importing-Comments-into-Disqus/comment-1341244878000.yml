message: "<p>Hello Celinahex,</p><p>It's been quite a while since I wrote this so I can't specifically recall why the content was included (or if it was actually necessary).  That being said, if you've tried to do the import and it's not working, I would try with the content encoded as well.  Outside of that, it would be difficult to tell what the issue might be without looking at the full xml you're trying to import.</p><p>Chris</p>"
