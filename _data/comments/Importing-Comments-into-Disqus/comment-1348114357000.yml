message: "<p>Thanks for this article. I am now in the painful process of manually importing comments from jcomments and I wonder about comment id. Should I make one up for each comment? What if it overlaps with an existing one? I would leave it ut but when there are replies to comments, you need the parent comment id. Any advice would be most welcome! Thanks</p>"
