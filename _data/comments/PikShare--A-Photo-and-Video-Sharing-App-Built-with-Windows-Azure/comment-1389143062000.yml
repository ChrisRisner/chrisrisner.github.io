message: "<p>I followed the instruction and imported the 3rd party lib but still got an error with the imported 3rd party lib.  It asked for SmoothProgressBar so I added another 3rd party but it doesn't seem to fix the reference issue so I am stuck.  How did you do it?  I am new to Android so not sure what I need to go.</p><p>Thanks Chris</p>"
