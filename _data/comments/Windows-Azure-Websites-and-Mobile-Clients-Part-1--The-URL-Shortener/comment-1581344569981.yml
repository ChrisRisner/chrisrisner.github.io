It feels unnatural because every album we ever did \r\nhas pretty much been recorded, than released a couple of months \r\nlater. That is just how out label worked. Your own personal feel natural \r\nto us that we have to wait that long, but \r\nbad it is actually for the better and that Wind Up has things set roughly \r\ngive us the proper release, which supplies us the best chance be successful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nT within the Park can be a large music festival locked \r\nin Scotland during the early July.

I've stayed true to what \r\nI like to do as a designer. That's all you may do.\r\nWhen you worry about fans and reaction, you wind up selling out.\r\n\r\nMany artists do that, and I cannot mention any names, but they'd rather make a shitload of cash.\r\n\r\nWhich is essential.
