message: "<p>We are using Visual Studio to create an Apache Cordova app that is connected to an Azure Mobile Service .  We are using the Cordova Push Plugin to receive Notifications in our app.  We have created a JavaScript method in the Azure Mobile Service to send the notifications, this method is triggered by a scheduler.  Please note that the intention is to send each Notification to a particular device.</p><p>The notifications work perfectly for Android devices but not for the iOS devices.</p><p>In iOS the notification is not received however the method in Azure Mobile Service always returns “Success”.<br>If we set the Device Token to \"Null\" , then it works for iOS devices (but sends to all devices not just one).</p><p>Could anyone please help us to resolve this issue?</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>"
