message: "<p>I'm still a little unclear on the \"tags\".  Where exactly are these tags kept?  Not sure if I am understand how they work.  If I have an app that has several games running, and I want to notify each user who is within that game, would each Tag be a separate game?  And if so, where is this \"tag\" stored?  On the server?  In a DB table ?  Sorry but new to notification and Azure.</p>"
