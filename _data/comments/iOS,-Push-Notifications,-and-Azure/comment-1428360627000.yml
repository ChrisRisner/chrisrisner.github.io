message: "<p>Is calling registerNativeWithDeviceToken() from the device itself is a best practice? <br>Alternatively,  the token from APNS could be sent from the client to the back-end, and there we would register the token with NH (maybe with a tag also). This way we don't have to save the connection string on the device itself which seems like a vulnerability.</p>"
