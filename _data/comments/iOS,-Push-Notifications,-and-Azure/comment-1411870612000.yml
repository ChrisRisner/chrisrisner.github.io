message: "<p>Hi Chris, Excellent tutorial. I followed it and the result was the expected (almost 3 weeks ago), but yesterday I tried it again, for a project that I'm working on, but the result was completely different. After verifying each line of this tutorial and check my two solutions I found that the only different is the SDK (iOS 7 - Xcode 5.1.1 vs iOS 8 SDK - Xcode 6). Looks like the following line is not registering the tags in the NH (and also is not sending any error).</p><p>[self.hub registerNativeWithDeviceToken:self.pushTokenData tags:tagSet completion:^(NSError* error)</p><p>I don't know if you know something about this or is only me. Thanks in advance</p>"
