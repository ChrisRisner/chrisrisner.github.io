message: "<p>If you need to secure what push notifications people receive, you should absolutely follow the path you've mentioned where you send the token to your own backend who then registers with your hub on behalf of the device.  A great example of this would be if you wanted to do push notifications based off the username.  You wouldn't want someone nefarious to add additional tags and start getting pushes for the wrong account.  Conversely, if you're doing a news app for example, it might not matter if all your tags are just tied to types of news (i.e. nothing sensitive).</p>"
