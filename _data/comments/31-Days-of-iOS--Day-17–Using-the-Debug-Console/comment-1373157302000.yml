message: "<p>Greetings Chris - thanks again for another informative tutorial. I broke my neck over twenty-five years ago. Because of my quadriplegia, I have been a cli person, for most of my computing history. I only recently delved into Mac OS X, earlier this year, in the hopes of writing apps for iOS devices. I have been a Slackware user, since the time it was available as an OS. Please continue to share your knowledge, as there are people who learn from the teachings of others. I am using xCode 4.6 and OS X 10.8.4 on an HP notebook (I'm unable to afford Apple hardware at this time). Thanks again.</p>"
