message: "<p>Chromebooks are targeted to specific types of users that want an easy to use, Internet-friendly browsing device.  They are not meant to replace the traditional PC or laptop.</p><p>In addition, there are third party apps out there that can bridge the gap for Chromebook users that require occasional access to those tools found only in a Windows environment.  For example, if a Chromebook user needs quick, easy, temporary access to a Windows desktop or Windows app, they can use Ericom AccessNow, a pure HTML5 RDP client that enables Chromebook users to connect to any RDP host, including Terminal Server (RDS Session Host), physical desktops or VDI virtual desktops - and run their applications and desktops and view all web sites in a browser.</p><p>You can even use AccessNow to run Internet Explorer on a Chromebook for those companies or web sites that require IE.</p><p>Ericom‘s AccessNow does not require Java, Flash, Silverlight, ActiveX, or any other underlying technology to be installed on end-user devices - an HTML5 browser is all that is required.</p><p>For more info visit:<br><a href=\"http://www.ericom.com/InternetExplorer-on-Chromebook-video.asp?URL_ID=708\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"http://www.ericom.com/InternetExplorer-on-Chromebook-video.asp?URL_ID=708\">http://www.ericom.com/Inter...</a></p><p>Note: I work for Ericom</p>"
