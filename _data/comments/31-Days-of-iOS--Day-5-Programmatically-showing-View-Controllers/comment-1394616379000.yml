message: "<p>Thank you Chris for the tutorial. I have tried to link page 1 to page 2, then from page 2 to page 3 by using storyboard id. It works fine between page 1 and page 2. However, I could not link page 2 to page 3. There is no error messages. Do we need to add any other code in order to link page 2 to page 3?</p>"
