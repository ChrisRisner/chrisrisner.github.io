message: "<p>Now, to get rid of the warnings and clean things up...</p><p>In SecondViewController.m, I made the following change to get rid of another 'depreciated' warning:</p><p>//  [self dismissModalViewControllerAnimated:YES];  //depreciated closer<br>    [self dismissViewControllerAnimated:YES completion:nil];</p><p>This also works for both the \"Show New View\" button, as well as the \"Item\" button in the Title bar...</p><p>I also removed from Main.Storyboard the Navigation Controller I dragged out earlier. It was causing warnings, and (as it turns out) isn't necessary. I guess all I needed to do was drag the 'Navigation Bar' to the top of the 'View' window... Runs like a champ.</p><p>Thanks again for the help. Having things not work exactly as planned means I have to learn... the hard (but far more effective) way.</p>"
