message: "<p>I know this tutorial is \"old\" but gold :) so <br>[self dismissModalViewControllerAnimated: YES]; has been deprecated. Instead I'm using [self dismissViewControllerAnimated:NO completion:nil]; . Builds and deploys but when clicking the button to close that triggers that method the iOS simulator crashes and I get an error. Been reading online different solutions but none make sense. Any ideas?</p>"
