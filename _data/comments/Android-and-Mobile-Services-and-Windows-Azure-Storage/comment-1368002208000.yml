message: "<p>sorry for the trouble. After viewing the codes the entire day, i got confused with the file directory at the source code. The dialog view also made it even more confusing especially for newbie like me. Is there a simple tutorial on how to select image then upload to the existing container? I done my service side and client side codes. However the main uploading blob data part (Blob Activity) is the one which is rather confusing.</p>"
