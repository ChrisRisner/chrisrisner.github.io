message: "<p>currently, i'm testing it out on my android phone and i have no problem creating containers at the containersactivity. I checked my storage and i can see the containers being created.  Soon, I selected the container name on the app and at the blobsactivity i was unable to create blob after select the image. I was also unable to test it out on my emulator as they prompt me a message stating no media was found.</p>"
