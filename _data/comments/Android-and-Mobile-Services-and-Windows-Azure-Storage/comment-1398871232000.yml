message: "<p>I can't get this to work in Android. I keep getting a NoClassDefFoundError. Has anyone got any idea what I am doing wrong?</p><p>I have - downloaded the modified Azure SDK from GitHib, downloaded the example app from GitHub, imported both into my workspace in Eclipse and linked the two projects but when I run (either in the android emulator or on my phone) when it tries to instantiate StorageService I get the aforementioned exception. Any help would be much appreciated as I have been looking at this for ages.</p>"
