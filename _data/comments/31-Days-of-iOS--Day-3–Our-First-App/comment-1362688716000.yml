message: "<p>Thanks Markus.  I originally wrote this article in 4.4 or 4.5 I believe.  I've added an update around which methods will show up in the ViewController.  As for lblInfo and txtText, they changed it so you either have to access them with _lblInfo and _txtText or the preferred (as far as I'm aware) self.lblInfo and self.txtInfo.  The difference is that using self.&lt;variable&gt; still uses the getter and setter where as _&lt;variable&gt; access the actual object.  If you're using the auto-generated getter and setter, it won't matter.  However, if you override the getter and setter, then self.&lt;variable&gt; will use that where as _&lt;variable&gt; would not.  Hope that helps.</p>"
