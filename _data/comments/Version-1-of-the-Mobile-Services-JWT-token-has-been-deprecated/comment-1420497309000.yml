message: "<p>dumb question.</p><p>Don't I have to pass in token in the header each time I do a call to the mobile services right?  whether I get it from 3rd party like FB or custom login?</p><p>If I set 'logged in' user only permission to insert then it will need a way to validate that you are who you say you are and logged in.  Does MobileServiceClient object knows currentuser that somehow?</p><p>thanks<br>wil</p>"
