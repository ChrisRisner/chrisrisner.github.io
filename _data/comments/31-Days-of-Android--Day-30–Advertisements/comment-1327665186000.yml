message: "<p>When you run an android application from eclipse and have a device plugged in and set for development mode, it should launch a window allowing you to choose which connected device, or emulator, you want to run on.   This screen contains the device id's.</p><p>Alternatively, you can open the DDMS perspective in eclipse which will show the device id's for all connected devices on the left side.</p>"
