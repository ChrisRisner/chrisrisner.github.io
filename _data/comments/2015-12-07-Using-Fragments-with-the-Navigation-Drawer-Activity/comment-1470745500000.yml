message: "<p>Ok, I just winged it and hoped for the best! :-)</p><p>Normal layout and -large layout attached as pics.  In OnCreate (and similarly in OnNavigationItemSelected) I use findViewById to see which view is loaded and set a class level variable to indicate single or multi pane.  The class level variable is set in OnCreate and used in OnNavigationItemSelected.</p><p>If multi pane, I use fragment manager to load both fragments into the main and detail frames.  I take care to handle the fact that I initially pass null into the new instance constructor on my detail fragment.</p><p>Hope I didn't miss anything?!</p>"
