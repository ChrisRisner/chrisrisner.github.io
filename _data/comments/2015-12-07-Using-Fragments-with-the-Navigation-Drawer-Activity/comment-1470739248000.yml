message: "<p>Hi Chris.  Great article!</p><p>I'm trying to make a design decision but having a tough time asking the right question.</p><p>Pushing different fragments into a frame layout in a single pane view with the Navigation drawer seems straight forward with your example.  I can't seem to find any input on how to handle different layouts in a multi pane scenario.</p><p>For example, in my project the layouts are different for each navigation item.  Let's say my first Navigation item is News.  My second is For Sale.  My third is weather. The summary and detail fragment layouts for my news articles is different to that of the summary and detail layouts of my For Sale items.  For weather I don't have summary and detail, I just have a single fragment layout.</p><p>When researching multi pane layouts, the standard thing you come across on the interweb is for you to add a xml layout file for your navigation drawer activity to the layout-large directory.  In there you do a Linear layout - orientation horizontal.  You add two fragment nodes, give each a name property (which essentially points to the fragment's actual layout file) and provide them with a weight to space them as you want.  But this is like hard coding which fragment you want in your large layout.</p><p>In my mind, I would rather have two frame layouts, each with a more generic id of main_frame &amp; detail_frame.  When I detect that I am on a multi pane device and the user clicked on \"News\", the main frame should list the summary view of the articles in main_frame with the selected article in detail_frame.  Then when the user opens the Nav drawer and selects \"For Sale\", the main_frame must show the summary items on sale and the detail of the first for sale item in the detail_frame.  When on weather, I don't want a split layout, just the weather across the entire screen.</p><p>So here's what I'm thinking.  In OnCreate and OnNavigationItemSelected - I should rather find view by id to see if I am in a single or multi pane layout - and then load the content of the main_frame.  I am however a bit uncertain about the detail part of it.</p><p>Because I'm not using \"fragment\" in the layout, but rather a \"frame layout\", I would assume the fragment manager is not automatically aware of what is going on - I will have to explicitly ask the fragment manager to load an instance of the email summary into main_frame and an instance of first email's detail into detail_frame.</p><p>I'm very new to Android development - come from an iOS background.  I have this feeling that this is actually a very simple thing to achieve and I'm missing one small step in the process.  Am I on the right track?</p>"
