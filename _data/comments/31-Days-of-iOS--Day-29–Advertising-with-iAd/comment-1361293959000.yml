message: "<p>Thanks for pointing out the mistakes.  Oddly enough in 2 of the 3 that you found, the code sample was in the post, just in the wrong place.</p><p>I definitely have some upcoming posts related more towards work (Windows Azure and Android / iOS) but also have some interest in doing more posts around game dev, hardware sensors, and updates to the Android series.  If you have any specific topics you'd like to see, let me know and I'll get them on my todo list.</p>"
