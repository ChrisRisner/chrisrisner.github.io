message: "<p>I now see the misplaced code blocks - I was not looking close enough to notice that they were a little further down in the article - thanks.</p><p>Each of your 31 days of Android and 31 days of iOS articles are extremely well done independently.  They are also quite valuable when taken together for someone interested in both platforms - they have similarities so that someone can compare how equivalent features are implemented in the different environments.  They also each demonstrate capabilities that are different and possibly unique in each environment, so that you can get a feel for what makes each environment appealing in its own way.  For those interested in both environments, this compare and contrast approach is really appreciated.</p><p>I think an article on creating and using custom view objects for Android (and the equivalent concept in iOS) would be great.  I would also like to learn about using the Fragments API in Android.  As other topics occur to me, I'll mention those later.</p><p>Thank for sharing your expertise with the world.</p>"
