message: "<p>Hi Chris,</p><p>In regards to expired authentication tokens, do you perhaps have an alternative method of handling those? As a user, I would get pretty frustrated logging in all the time. Seems like there should be a way to keep that authentication token valid while the user is still active within the expiration period, and then maybe force a logout/login once there hasn't been any activity within that expiration period. Thanks!</p>"
