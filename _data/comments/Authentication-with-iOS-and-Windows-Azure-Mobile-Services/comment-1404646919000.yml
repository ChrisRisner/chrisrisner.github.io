From my understanding, I DO need the JS back-end in order to get additional user profile information from the Facebook user, such as Friends List, their profile pic, etc..</p><p>If it simply authenticating based on Facebook for example, then yes I can use the individual provider auths, but that won't come with the additional information pertaining to the Facebook user. Am I correct with this?</p>"
