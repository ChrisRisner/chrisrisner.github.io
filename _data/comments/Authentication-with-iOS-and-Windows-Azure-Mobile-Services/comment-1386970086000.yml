message: "<p>According to this (<a href=\"http://bit.ly/IKmvET)\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"http://bit.ly/IKmvET)\">http://bit.ly/IKmvET)</a> the URL returned is a redirect to the current actual URL of the profile image.  It doesn't sound like there is a way around using that to get the redirect URL.  If you're getting the username, you could also use this URL: <a href=\"https://graph.facebook.com/<username>/picture\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"https://graph.facebook.com/<username>/picture\">https://graph.facebook.com/...</a> but that will still need to do a redirect.  It seems like since the URL of the actual picture can change, to be safe you have to go through the redirect.</p>"
