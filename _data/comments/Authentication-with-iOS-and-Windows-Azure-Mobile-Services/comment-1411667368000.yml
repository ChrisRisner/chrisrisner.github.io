message: "<p>With the Node.js backend, you're kind of stuck at the whims of the runtime right now which is a 30 day expiration for tokens from any providers (if you do custom auth, you specify your own expiration term).  If you use the .NET backend, I believe you can alter this expiration behavior.  Alternatively, if you do client side authentication (not possible today with all providers) you should be able to get a refresh token from the provider which will allow you to reauth from the client without popping up a login window.</p>"
