message: "<p>Hi Chris, I am using the authservice successfully, thanks - I like having this grouped in one place - I'm trying a mix of typed and untyped data, I've got the untyped working but do you have any example of using the authservice with v2 SDK and typed data hooking up to the authservice, much appreciated - UPDATE -  I've gone back to untyped data with an arraylist and figured it out</p>"
