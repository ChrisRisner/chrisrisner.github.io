message: "<p>Thanks for your reply, I am just repeat what your have done from the initial version of codes, wondering why Eclipse can't resolve the new add layout \"R.layout.list_item\", it displayed with a red underline, but can be seen in <a href=\"http://R.java\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"R.java\">R.java</a>. Seems many people hat met this issue before, maybe caused by the installation of Eclipse. Anyway It is neither a big problem nor your codes' problem. I should try more......</p>"
