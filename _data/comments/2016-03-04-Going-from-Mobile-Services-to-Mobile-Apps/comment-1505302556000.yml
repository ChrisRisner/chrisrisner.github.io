message: "<p>Hi, Chris! Thank you for this very useful content. I've just read the \"Android and Mobile Services and Windows Azure Storage\" : <a href=\"http://chrisrisner.com/Android-and-Mobile-Services-and-Windows-Azure-Storage\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"http://chrisrisner.com/Android-and-Mobile-Services-and-Windows-Azure-Storage\">http://chrisrisner.com/Andr...</a>. I know that \"Mobile Services\" are now \"Mobile Apps\" and I've started a new Android app using Mobile Apps. My problem is that I want to be able to store and sync image files, not only data. I guess that I cannot simply insert, update and delete image files like I do with the other data types. How can I achieve this, generally? Should I combine another Azure service along with Mobile Apps? I've also posted my question in stackoverflow: <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46178505/image-files-sync-in-azure-mobile-apps-for-android/46192521#46192521\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46178505/image-files-sync-in-azure-mobile-apps-for-android/46192521#46192521\">https://stackoverflow.com/q...</a> . Please, any hint to the correct direction will be very useful to me. Thank you!</p>"
