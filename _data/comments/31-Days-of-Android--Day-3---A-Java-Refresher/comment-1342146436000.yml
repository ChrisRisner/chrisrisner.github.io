message: "<p>Hi Rupert,</p><p>That was struck out because originally in this article I said they had to be final static variables, so something like:     final static int myInt = 5;However, you don't need them to be static.  Something like this would be acceptable:     final int myInt 5;<br>     switch (5) {<br>          case myInt:<br>              //do something;<br>              break;<br>    }</p>"
