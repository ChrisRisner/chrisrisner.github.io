message: "<p>We've run into similar problems and it seems GoDaddy is unwilling to change anything about their email service. We use them for everything, but now our clients are complaining that their emails are getting marked as spam because the recipients email servers subscribe to spam lists of blacklisted servers, and GoDaddy's is blacklisted. It's unfortunate because they are affordable, but it might be time to start looking elsewhere. It's a shame they seem unwilling to listen to the voice of their customers, a voice that seems to be growing.</p>"
