message: "<p>NSDictionary is a data structure you can use in Objective-C to hold name-value pairs in memory.  NSUserDefaults is a technique for storing data in the device's file system so it will be available the next time the app runs (as well as to different areas of your application).  It's possible to store a NSDictionary in NSUserDefaults if you want to.</p>"
