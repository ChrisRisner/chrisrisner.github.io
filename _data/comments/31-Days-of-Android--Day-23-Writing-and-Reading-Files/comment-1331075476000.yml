message: "<p>I have a question. When I use MODE_WORLD_READABLE, and MODE_WORLD_WRITEABLE, does that just mean that the file that is created has the User permissions set to -rw-?</p><p>In other words, does any file with read and write access turned on, stored in internal memory, become readable and writable by any other app, despite the UID sandboxing? I mean, I've looked at a lot of files in my handset's internal memory, and most seem to have read and write turned on by default, which seems like a security risk.</p>"
