message: "<p>Hi Chris, Thank you, this is just what I was looking for. I have a question: I'm planning to make an app for Android where users authenticate first and when they do so they can store and access their own files \"blobs\" (something like dropbox or skydrive). I think what I have to change is the insert and read scripts for the blob containers but I have no clue where to add such parameters.<br>Can you tell me how? I'll be very grateful!</p>"
