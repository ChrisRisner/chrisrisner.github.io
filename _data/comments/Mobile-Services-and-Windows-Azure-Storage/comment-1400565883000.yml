message: "<p>Hi Dave,  the script above returns more details than just the names of the blobs.  Possibly the best thing to do would be to add a console.log(blobs) statement before you call request.respond so you can see the format of the data.  You can then create a strongly typed data object and have the readAsync return a collection of those.  Hope that helps.</p>"
