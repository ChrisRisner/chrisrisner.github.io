message: "<p>One other question:  Is it possible to create other columns in the Blob storage?  Meaning, right now when I view a container I created, it has NAME, URL, LAST MODIFIED and SIZE for columns.  I would like to actually have a few other fields in there.  Ideally, I would like to store two images, original and a thumbnail.  Possible?  Can user defined fields be created in a container just like in a table?  Sorry for all questions, nube and trying to wrap my head around this.  Thx in advance.</p>"
