message: "<p>Related to this, I can't get the example project to work with the latest version of the SDK (v1.2.3). I swap out the older SDK its currently using for v1.2.3 and only rename a few function calls as need (e.g. getTable to tableWithName, ApplicationURLWithString:WithApplicationKey: to ApplicationURLWithString:applicationKey:, etc.). After the app builds, clicking \"Blob Storage\" crashes with the following output:</p><p><a href=\"https://gist.github.com/acannon828/5c5b6184d6e1fb8bf1aa\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"https://gist.github.com/acannon828/5c5b6184d6e1fb8bf1aa\">https://gist.github.com/aca...</a></p><p>My personal app has similar issues. It works fine with the same older version of the SDK that's used in the example project, but one that's swapped out for v1.2.3 it crashes as well:</p><p><a href=\"https://gist.github.com/acannon828/1b5bbffdb5ae34117dc7\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"https://gist.github.com/acannon828/1b5bbffdb5ae34117dc7\">https://gist.github.com/aca...</a></p>"
