message: "<p>Just  tested it out, it looks like the MSFilter method signature changed.  It should now be this:</p><p>- (void) handleRequest:(NSURLRequest *)request next:(MSFilterNextBlock)onNext response:(MSFilterResponseBlock)onResponse {</p><p>Replace your existing filter method sig with that and things should work for you again.  You can use the same code body from the existing filter method.</p>"
