message: "<p>Hi. I'm trying to upload to the blob storage but I can't figure out what the \"BlobBlobs\" table should be. Is it just a random table or should it somehow be associated with the SAS? If I use a random table, the completion block returns a dictionary with key \"id\" and value with id of the created row and not a SAS URL.</p>"
