message: "<p>Related to this, the example code does not work for me with the latest iOS SDK (v 1.2.3). I swapped out the older framework in your example project with v1.2.3 and only renamed all `getTable` and `ApplicationWithURL:withApplicationKey` calls. Once the app builds, clicking \"Blob Storage\" crashes the app with the following output:</p><p><a href=\"https://gist.github.com/acannon828/1b5bbffdb5ae34117dc7\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"https://gist.github.com/acannon828/1b5bbffdb5ae34117dc7\">https://gist.github.com/aca...</a></p><p>I'm having similar problems using the StorageService class in my own app. It works fine with the older SDK but crashes with v1.2.3.</p>"
