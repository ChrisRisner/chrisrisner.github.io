message: "<p>One of your scripts is causing the error you posted above.  You can figure out exactly which line by putting in more console.log statements into the script.  This should help us narrow down specifically which part of the script is causing it to happen.  If your Mobile Service and your storage account are both in Asia, network issues shouldn't be causing the script to run long as the error is indicating.</p>"
