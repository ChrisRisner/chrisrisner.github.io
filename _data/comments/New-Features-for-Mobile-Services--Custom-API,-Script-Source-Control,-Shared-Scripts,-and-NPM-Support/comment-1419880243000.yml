message: "<p>You have three options for doing multiple inserts:  <br>1.  Perform the operation three times from your client (bad as this will inflate your API call #s)<br>2.  Create a custom API that can handle performing multiple inserts (as you suggested)<br>3.  Edit your insert script so it's capable of handling one or multiple inserts (not unlike what you'd do for a custom API).</p><p>2 and 3 are the better options and they'll end up being very similar.</p>"
