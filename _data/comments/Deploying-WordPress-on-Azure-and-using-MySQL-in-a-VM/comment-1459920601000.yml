message: "<p>In the example above, you can see the name of the MySQL DB I've exported from ClearDB is named \"sailingaicrbzbwe\".  However, you can create a database of any name you want (or rename the db) once it's in MySQL on the VM.  So, if you import the exact same database into your MySQL VM, it should match the name of the DB that was on ClearDB.  Are you able to connect to the DB running in the VM from the workbench?</p>"
