message: "<p>Hi Adr,</p><p>I'll try and dig through my files and find my original source.  Sorry it wasn't attached at the time.  While I'm looking / in case I can't find it, is there a specific reference issue you're running into?  I believe if you add a reference to the Exchange 2007 dlls (linked above) to your project, Visual Studio should be able to help you add all the necessary references to your code files.</p><p>Chris</p>"
