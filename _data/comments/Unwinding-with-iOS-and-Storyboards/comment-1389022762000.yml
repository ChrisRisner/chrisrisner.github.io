message: "<p>This unwinding is included in the apple-online tutorial for beginners and I'm kind of stuck there. It is set modal and I have the controller subclasses and everything, but I can't draw from a button to that \"exit\" box. It is possible to draw from the button to the box \"first responder\" or to any other view/navigation controller though. Any hint?</p>"
