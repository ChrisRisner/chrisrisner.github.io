I just finished giving my presentation at [Codemash 2016](http://codemash.org) and thought it went great.  I presented on running .NET on Linux and OS X and had a nearly full room of very engaged people.  My presentation focused on ASP.NET 5 and .NET Core, their recent status as a Release Candidate, and how developers can use, run, and deploy them on Linux and OS X.  People were [super excited](https://twitter.com/jesseobrien_/status/685114919432404992) to see how fast you could get up to speed on running .NET on Linux.  If you're interested in checking out my slides, you can find them [here](../presentations/2016-CodeMash-DotNetOnLinuxOSX.pptx).  Thanks to all who attended and reach out to me if you have questions.
