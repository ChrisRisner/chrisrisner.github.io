<p><img style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; display: inline; float: right" align="right" src="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/windowsazurevertical.jpg" width="300" height="129" />This is coming out a little later than I had hoped but, better late than never.&#160; A couple weeks ago I created a few screencasts to walk developers through setting up and running the <a title="URL Shortener Wrapup" href="http://chrisrisner.com/Windows-Azure-Websites-and-Mobile-Clients--Wrap-Up">URL Shortener</a> that I discussed in detail a few weeks back.&#160; Today I’ve finally had the time to get them uploaded and tagged in YouTube and they are now available for you to watch.&#160; The screencasts are split into three different videos: setting up the PHP site, getting the iOS app running, and getting the Android app running.</p>  <p><strong></strong></p>  <p><strong>Setting up the PHP site</strong></p>  <p>The <a title="Setting up the PHP site video on youtube" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZveNVwfop0&amp;feature=youtu.be">first video</a> goes through pulling down the PHP source code, adding a new website in the Windows Azure portal, configuring the site, and uploading it to Windows Azure.&#160; After watching this video, you should be comfortable with running the URL Shortening website in Windows Azure.</p>  <p><iframe height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/LZveNVwfop0" frameborder="0" width="420" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p><strong>Getting the iOS app running</strong></p>  <p>The <a title="Running the URL Shortener iOS App youtube video" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf_Gc1atnuM&amp;feature=youtu.be">second video</a> will walk you through pulling down the source code for the iOS app, configuring it to connect to your website, and running it.&#160; Finally, the video reviews the different areas of the code that connect to Windows Azure.</p>  <p><iframe height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Rf_Gc1atnuM" frameborder="0" width="420" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p><strong>Getting the Android app running</strong></p>  <p>The <a title="Running the Android App youtube video" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stlxRbZk0ro&amp;feature=youtu.be">third video</a> will walk you through pulling down the source code for the Android app, configuring it to connect to your website, and running it.&#160; Finally, the video reviews the different areas of the code that connect to Windows Azure.</p>  <p><iframe height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/stlxRbZk0ro" frameborder="0" width="560" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p><strong>Why Screencasts?</strong></p>  <p>I haven’t done screencasts before (which may be obvious when you watch these) but I do believe that different people learn and absorb things differently.&#160; For some people, these videos may be easier to learn from then trying to go through a six part blog series.&#160; If these are useful, I may stear more content into screencasts (while still blogging about it of course).&#160; If you find the videos useful or have any feedback on them, please let me know.</p>
