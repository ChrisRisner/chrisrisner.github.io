<p><img style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; display: inline; float: right" title="31 Days of Android" alt="31 Days of Android" align="right" src="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/android-200.png" />It’s been just over a week since I wrapped up the last day of the <a title="31 Days of Android" href="http://chrisrisner.com/31-Days-of-Android">31 Days of Android</a>.&#160; This was a really fun series to work on but it took a lot out of me.&#160; Today I’d like to talk about some of the lessons learned during and after writing the series.&#160; These are tips that might be useful to you if you’re planning a long running series and are certainly things I’d like to remember going forward.&#160; Unlike the rest of the series, there won’t be any coding in this article.&#160; </p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p><strong>Don’t Overcommit</strong></p>  <p>Naming a blog series “<a title="31 Days of Android" href="http://chrisrisner.com/31-Days-of-Android">31 Days of Android</a>” and starting to post an article every day, kind of implies that you’re going to post an article every day for 31 days straight.&#160; Not 7 for the first 7 days and then 1 every other day for the next 48 days.&#160; It may not seem like it due to the quality of some of the articles (I can admit that many of them could be better) but each one takes a while to write.&#160; While some of them took a few hours, most of them took much longer.&#160; If you’re going to try to get one out every day, make sure you’ve got the time to commit to it or plan ahead.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p><strong>Plan Ahead</strong></p>  <p>If you’re going to get an article out every day and you know, or even suspect, that it’s going to take a while to write each one, write as many as you can ahead of time.&#160; I didn’t start the series until I had written rough drafts for about 8 articles.&#160; However, shortly after I started posting, I lost my 8 article head start.&#160; I think the big risk on not posting an article as soon as you’re done writing it is that it becomes irrelevant.&#160; This could have happened with <a title="Day 1 in the 31 Days of Android: Setting up the Development Environment" href="http://chrisrisner.com/31-Days-of-Android--Day-1---Getting-Set-Up-for-Development">my first entry which detailed out to set up and install your development environment</a>.&#160; I’m sure it will only be a matter of time before Google releases a new version of the ADK that slightly alters the installation and setup steps.&#160; However, I think the risk is worth it to make sure you’re not putting too much work on your shoulders every night to get an article out each day.&#160; If you don’t plan ahead, you’ll need to make a decision about how much time you can devote to your writing.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p><strong>Be Willing to Sacrifice or Be Flexible with Standards</strong></p>  <p>Since I didn’t plan ahead appropriately, I ended up working several hours each night (and sometimes the following morning) to make sure I got an article out.&#160; I was insistent that I get out one article every single day and didn’t have a gap (one of the articles actually went out about 30 minutes after midnight on the following day).&#160; This meant that during the week I’d get home from work and then focus, as much as I could, on writing an article so it would be ready for posting the next morning.&#160; As a result, some of the articles I got out weren’t the best they could have been.&#160; Looking at some of the articles, it’s clear the quality and amount of information could have been better.&#160; I hadn’t planned on 3 days of Intents but had to move things to follow up articles when I ran out of time.&#160; At one point in the content provider article (deleting), I just didn’t have time to figure it out.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p><strong>Sketch out your Series Plans</strong></p>  <p>This is something I did before starting the series and was very thankful I had.&#160; Prior to starting writing on anything, I mapped out what I wanted to write about for each day of the series.&#160; My failure was in completing each article as planned.&#160; At some points I had to break out what I was writing into several days or move articles earlier or later in the series to make more sense.&#160; Having a roadmap already defined was key in making sure I still accomplished what I wanted in the series even when I was making cuts.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p><strong>In the End</strong></p>  <p>While this series took quite a toll on me, it was totally worth writing.&#160; I feel like I’ve learned a lot about both Android and blogging.&#160; I’m much more capable of explaining some of the concepts of Android now and that’s already coming in handy at work.&#160; Furthermore, I think future articles I write will benefit from this experience.&#160; I don’t know if I’ll write a “Days of” series again (and if it is, I don’t think it will be 31!), but I hope it will end up being a better experience having learned the lessons above.</p>  <p><strong></strong></p>  <p><strong>What’s Next</strong></p>  <p>The series ended just over a week ago and I’ve taken a much needed break from writing anything since then.&#160; I haven’t, however, taken a break from thinking about stuff I’d like to write about.&#160; At the beginning of November, I wrote an <a title="Some thoughts on Siri and Google" href="http://chrisrisner.com/Some-Thoughts-on-Siri-and-Google">article about some thoughts on Siri</a> and how Google could probably roll out a Siri like product.&#160; Shortly after that I had a quick Google Plus talk with a person in Developer Relations at Google about how they’d like to control their music with their voice.&#160; This was already somewhat possible using <a title="Voice Actions" href="http://www.google.com/mobile/voice-actions/">Voice Actions</a>, but there were some pieces missing.&#160; I got motivated and wrote an Android app to handle it.&#160; Over the next couple of months I’m planning on open sourcing that program and writing some articles about how it works.&#160; Hopefully this will enable other developers to more easily get voice control into their own apps.&#160; In addition to that, there were a few articles I had to cut out of the 31 Days series (dialogs, maps, animations) that I would still like to write about.&#160; Some of these are stubs I’ve already created and should be able to get out soon(ish).&#160; Others will probably come later.&#160; Lastly, I’ve got a few more personal things to talk about (<a title="Brewing Beer" href="http://chrisrisner.com/Nothing-beats-Prohibition-like-making-your-own-Booze">more beer brewing</a> and <a title="Chromebook Stuff" href="http://chrisrisner.com/Samsung-Chromebook-Unboxed-and-Occasionally-Used">chromebook experiences</a>).&#160; If you’re finishing up reading the <a title="31 Days of Android" href="http://chrisrisner.com/31-Days-of-Android">31 Days of Android</a> and have thoughts, feedback, or requests for other articles on Android development, let me know.</p>
