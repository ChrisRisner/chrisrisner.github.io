<p>While innocently adding some files to my ftp server so that I could access them remotely, I logged into my server interface to check on some permissions.&#160; Then I noticed something a little funky going on.&#160; Someone was repeatedly trying to log in to my ftp server.&#160;&#160; What kind of craziness could this be?</p>  <p><a onclick="return hs.expand(this)" class="highslide" href="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/634031619514586913.jpg"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; margin: 0px auto; display: block; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="FTP Log" border="0" alt="Ftp Log" src="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/634031619514586913.jpg" /></a> Why would this “Angelica” person be trying to get into my ftp server?&#160; I scrolled up and realized it wasn’t just her.&#160; Angelica’s friends Angela and Angel were also trying to get at my files from the same IP!&#160; Could it be as the stars had foretold and that a 4-some with ftp aware girls was finally going to go down?&#160; There was only one way to find out.&#160; I did a <a title="Who Is" href="http://ws.arin.net/whois">“Who Is” check</a> on the IP address.&#160; Alas, the requests were all coming from an <a title="IP in Amsterdam" href="http://ws.arin.net/whois/?queryinput=83.224.68.30">IP in Amsterdam</a>.&#160;&#160;&#160; So either 3 Dutch chicks are really lonely or, more likely, my ftp server was under a brute force attack.&#160; At this point I can feel nothing but pride.&#160; Though, if they were up to Angelica, how many attempts had they already made?&#160;&#160; Sadly, I couldn’t figure out how to make my ftp server redirect them to zombo.com, so I settled with blocking their IP address.</p>
