<p><a href="http://www.Beachbody.com/P90X "><img style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 10px; display: inline" alt="p90x2" align="right" src="http://kevinprice.com/images/p90x2.jpg" /></a></p>  <p>After months of encouragement from my friend <a href="http://kevinprice.com/">Kevin</a>, I finally got off my ass and ordered ripcords last Thursday so I could start P90X.&#160; Kevin began doing it several months ago and has extolled the benefits of the program to me on a pretty regular basis (and writes pretty regularly about working out, nutrition, etc…so all of the things you probably don’t care about if you’re reading this).&#160; After the bands got in on Saturday, I decided I had spent too much money and time to continue to ignoring it.&#160; So today after work, I came home and decided to attack the fitness test and day one of the program, “Chest, Back, and Ab-Ripper X”.&#160; The program doesn’t, and I wouldn’t, suggest doing both of those on the same day, especially without taking a break in between like I did, but I felt i was in good enough shape to give it a go.&#160; <br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The fitness test is primarily a way of making sure you’re in good enough shape to actually do P90X (I’d recommend figuring this out before you GET P90X) as opposed to a real work out.&#160; The woman got a huge laugh out of my first attempt to do pull ups with the bands.&#160; The way that works is that you jam one end of a small piece of fabric through a door jam and close it.&#160; You then run your band through the exposed end of the fabric.&#160; This works under the idea that the end you put through the jam has a small item in it which prevents it from coming through the jam.&#160; Unfortunately, the first time I did this, that item (I’m not exactly sure what it is) was not fully through the jam.&#160; This resulted in the band flying back to hit me in the chest in a very painful manner.&#160; After Erin cleared the tears from laughing so hard she cried, we continued on.&#160; After finishing the test, I decided to jump right into day one.&#160; Erin felt like getting a bit more exercise (she ran earlier in the day) so she joined me for the workout.    <br />&#160;&#160; Day one, “Chest, Back, and Ab-Ripper X” has left me already sore.&#160; The workout (“Chest and back”) is for the most part alternating between pushups and pull ups with 2 or 3 different band moves thrown in.&#160; The pull ups weren’t very difficult at all (I think I’m going to be investing in a pull up bar very soon to make this a bit more difficult) but the pushups wrecked both Erin and I.&#160; I’ve attempted (but gotten too lazy to finish) the 100 pushup challenge before and gotten a good distance into it but the amount and different style pushups in the first day was unbelievable.&#160; I feel no shame in admitting that I was doing less than the woman on the video.&#160; Following that, we did the Ab-Ripper X workout as well.&#160; Ab-Ripper X was short and sweet and only involved ab related moves (as you might imagine).&#160; So far I’m not disappointed with getting this going (finally) and look forward to tomorrows cardio.</p>
