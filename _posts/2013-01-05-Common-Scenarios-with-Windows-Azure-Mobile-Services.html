This has to do with an issue with how Froyo accepts SSL requests that was fixed in subsequent versions of Android.</p>


<p>&#160;</p>  <p><strong>Mobile Services Stuff</strong></p>  <p><a title="Windows Azure Mobile Services forum" href="http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/azuremobile/threads">Windows Azure Mobile Services forum</a> – If you have problems or questions, this is a great place to check and ask.&#160; It’s monitored by the product team on a daily basis.</p>  <p><a title="Mobile Services Code Samples" href="http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/windowsazure/site/search?f%5B0%5D.Type=Technology&amp;f%5B0%5D.Value=Windows%20Azure%20Mobile%20Services&amp;f%5B0%5D.Text=Windows%20Azure%20Mobile%20Services">Mobile Services Code Samples</a> – There are quite a few great sample apps here.&#160; For now they are all C# and / or JavaScript.&#160; This includes the <a title="EventBuddy Sample" href="http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/windowsazure/Event-Buddy-ddafd9b6">EventBuddy</a> sample seen at during the <a title="Build 2012 Day 2 keynote" href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2012/1-002">Build 2012 conference’s day 2 keynote</a>.</p>  <p><a title="Windows Azure Mobile Services SDK Source Code on GitHub" href="https://github.com/WindowsAzure/azure-mobile-services">Mobile Services SDK Source Code</a> – Shortly after launching Mobile Services, the SDK was released to GitHub.&#160; As changes are made to the SDK the version in GitHub will be updated to match.</p>  <p><a title="Windows Azure Mobile Services Reference" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsazure/jj554228">Mobile Services Reference</a> – This documentation details many of the different concepts and capabilities of Mobile Services.</p>  

<p><a title="Server Side Script Reference" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsazure/jj554226.aspx">Service Side Script Reference</a> – While a part of the reference docs above, this is a really handy section so I’m listing it separate.</p>  
<p><a title="REST API Reference" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsazure/jj710108.aspx">REST API Reference</a> - This is another part of the reference material above.  This goes over the actual REST API created for your Mobile Service.  You can use this to figure out how to access your Mobile Service from any other technology that doesn't have a supported SDK.</p>


<p><a title="Josh introduces Mobile Services" href="http://thejoyofcode.com/Introducing_Windows_Azure_Mobile_Services.aspx">What is Mobile Services and Why was it made</a> – Josh, one of the creators of Mobile Services, has a nice write up on the motivation for making Mobile Services here.</p>  <p><a title="Using Filters on Mobile Services clients" href="http://www.thejoyofcode.com/Filter_this_Day_3_.aspx">Using Filters on the Client side</a> – Josh delivers again by explaining how to use Filters to indicate a busy or active status to the client.&#160; Code included covers C# and Objective-C.</p>  <p><a title="Android Mobile Services SDK" href="https://github.com/goldshtn/wams-android">Unofficial Android SDK</a> – Prior to the release of the official Android SDK for Mobile Services in March of 2013, Microsoft MVP, and my friend, Sasha Goldshtein, worked very hard on an Android SDK for Mobile Services.&#160; This thing gives you all of the capabilities of each other platform (data, auth, and push) with easy integration.</p>  
<p><a href="https://github.com/zaxy78/azure-mobile-wp7-sdk">Unofficial WP7 C# SDK</a> - There isn't any official support for Windows Phone 7 at this time either.  Another community member stepped up and created an unofficial one for Windows Phone 7 in C#

<p><a title="Supporting Complex Types in C#" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/carlosfigueira/archive/2012/09/06/supporting-arbitrary-types-in-azure-mobile-services-managed-client-complex-types.aspx">Supporting complex types in C#</a> – This is similar to the previous link as it involves using a special converter to convert complex (i.e. objects containing objects) objects into JSON for Mobile Services to handle.&#160; Again, the code is specific to .NET but the idea could be adopted to other platforms.</p>

<p><a title="Supporting Complex Types in Android" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/carlosfigueira/archive/2013/08/29/complex-types-and-azure-mobile-services-android-version.aspx">Supporting complex types in Android</a> – This post covers how to deal with complex types (i.e. typed objects with typed objects inside them) from the Android SDK.  It's similar (and references) the above post but focuses on the Java Android SDK for Mobile Services.</p>
