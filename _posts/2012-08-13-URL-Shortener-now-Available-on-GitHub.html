<p><img style="margin: 0px 0px 15px 5px; display: inline; float: right" title="Windows Azure" alt="Windows Azure" align="right" src="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/windowsazurevertical.jpg" width="300" height="129" />Recently I blogged a <a title="URL Shortener Wrap Up" href="http://chrisrisner.com/Windows-Azure-Websites-and-Mobile-Clients--Wrap-Up">few articles</a> about a <a title="PHP URL Shortener Service" href="http://chrisrisner.com/Windows-Azure-Websites-and-Mobile-Clients-Part-2--The-PHP-Code">PHP URL Shortening service running on Windows Azure Websites</a> and the <a title="iOS Client for URL Shortener" href="http://chrisrisner.com/Windows-Azure-Websites-and-Mobile-Clients-Part-3---The-iOS-Client">iOS</a> and <a title="Android URL Shortener" href="http://chrisrisner.com/Windows-Azure-Websites-and-Mobile-Clients-Part-6--The-Android-Client">Android</a> clients that connected to it.&#160; In each article, I had a link to the archived code for whatever the article was covering.&#160; Today I can happily say that these samples have been added to <a title="Windows Azure Samples" href="https://github.com/WindowsAzure-Samples">GitHub</a> and are open sourced under the Apache 2 license.&#160; </p>  <p>This is actually the first time I’ve released something as open source under a license.&#160; It’s nice to know that this is now available to anyone that might want to use it and that it’s now possible to log issues and do pull requests using GitHub if anyone out there wants to make enhancements to it.&#160; The samples are split into three different repos:</p>  <ul>   <li><a title="PHP URL Shortener on GitHub" href="https://github.com/WindowsAzure-Samples/UrlShortener-PHP">PHP Site / Service</a> </li>    <li><a title="iOS Client for URL Shortener on GitHub" href="https://github.com/WindowsAzure-Samples/UrlShortener-iOS-Client">iOS Client</a> </li>    <li><a title="Android client for URL Shortener on GitHub" href="https://github.com/WindowsAzure-Samples/UrlShortener-Android-Client">Android Client</a> </li> </ul>  <p>If you are new to Windows Azure, you can <a title="Windows Azure Free Trial" href="http://aka.ms/UrlShortenerFreeWindowsAzureTrial">sign up for a free trial here</a>.&#160; That trial will enable you to create a Windows Azure Website along with a MySQL database to use for the PHP service.&#160; If you have any thoughts, concerns, or questions about any of these samples, please let me know.&#160; Coming soon will be screencasts of setting up the website as well as how to create each client.</p>
