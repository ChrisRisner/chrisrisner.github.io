<p><img style="margin: 0px 10px 5px 0px; display: inline" align="left" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_GwI4arXbyZ8/Sm53U4qUDeI/AAAAAAAAAK8/AvGzSN3U3t0/s400/The+Whitney,+Detroit.jpg" />From September 18th through the 27th, several (17) of Detroit’s “finest” restaurants are taking part in an event known as “<a href="http://detroitrestaurantweek.com/" target="_blank">Restaurant Week</a>”.&#160; RW is basically a “week” of preset and cheap offerings from pretty nice restaurants with the goal of getting you to experience places you normally might not (and then come back and spend big money there).&#160; As I only found out about RW today and I have a pretty packed weekend, I went about trying to figure out which of these restaurants Erin and I could hit up this week.&#160; After checking out the list and getting some recommendations from people, I first wanted to go to the <a href="http://www.rattlesnakeclub.com/detroit/index.php" target="_blank">Rattlesnake Club</a>.&#160; The entree options there included a 14oz strip steak and a 1.25 lb Maine lobster: tasty.&#160; Alas, it wasn’t meant to be as they were already booked for the rest of the weekend.&#160; Evaluating the rest of the places led to us deciding upon <a href="http://thewhitney.com/" target="_blank">the Whitney</a>.&#160; TW doesn’t offer any parking at the actual location outside of valet.&#160; Oddly enough the entrance and exit for valet are the same single lane so try not to run into another car.&#160; We both knew what we were going to order off the minimal list before we arrived so the only thing we had to decide upon was what to drink.&#160; Being fans of Cabernet we looked there first.&#160; The cheapest bottle was $35 which we ordered.&#160; A few minutes later the waitress returned to tell us that they were out (despite them later serving it by the glass to a couple sitting behind us) but brought the next bottle up (which we were fully charged for).&#160; The food and service were pretty good.&#160; That being said, I don’t think I’d be happy paying $50+ per person for what we got for $27 each.&#160; The location is pretty dark due to the dark color of the wood but very classy as well. While seating another group one of the servers actually showed them a hidden vault hidden behind one of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Whitney_House" target="_blank">very old house’s</a> walls.&#160; So while the Whitney was good, I wish we’d had a chance to try some of the other restaurants and look forward to Restaurant Week 2010.</p>
