<p><img style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; display: inline; float: right" title="Apple iOS" alt="Apple iOS" align="right" src="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/200px-Apple-logo.png" width="180" height="220" />For the first article in <a title="31 Days of iOS" href="http://chrisrisner.com/31-Days-of-iOS">this series on iOS development</a>, we’re going to talk about how you get set up for development.&#160; Thankfully, Apple has made things very easy on new developers.&#160; The only thing you really HAVE to do, is install Apple’s integrated development environment (IDE): <a title="XCode" href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/">XCode</a>.&#160; Xcode is free for installation to anyone with OSX Lion or Mountain Lion (as of writing) and can be installed from the Mac App Store.&#160; If you haven’t picked up on things yet, you need to be running OSX in order to do any native iOS development.&#160; If you have an older Mac sitting around, it may be powerful enough to use Xcode (provided you’re not taxing the computer in too many other ways).&#160; Let’s get back to talking about Xcode.</p>  <p><strong>Xcode</strong></p>  <p>Xcode has been around since 2003 and is Apple’s IDE for developing for iOS and OSX.&#160; Xcode supports developing in C, C++, Objective-C, Applescript, and Java (though not recommended).&#160; Because XCode is developed by Apple (and used by Apple to develop their own iOS and OSX apps) they’ve paid a great deal of attention to the quality of the IDE.&#160; Coming from a background where I’ve used many different IDEs, I would place Xcode far above Eclipse (used for Android among other things) and below Visual Studio (at least for some things) as far as the quality of the IDE.&#160; The point is, it’s a pretty polished tool.&#160; As of the 4.0 release (which if you’re just getting started now, you’ll be using an even newer version) Xcode was integrated with Interface Builder so you no longer have to use a separate app to work on the UI.&#160; We’ll cover more of the intricacies of Xcode as we progress along with the series.&#160; For now, let’s go ahead and get it installed.&#160; From the dock, open up the App Store:</p>  <p><img style="display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" title="Opening the AppStore" alt="Opening the AppStore" src="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/xcode-install-app-store.png" /></p>  <p>With that done, enter “Xcode” into the search bar in the top right of the App Store.&#160; The first result that comes up should be Xcode:</p>  <p><img style="display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" title="XCode in the App Store" alt="XCode in the App Store" src="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/Xcode-in-app-store.jpg" /></p>  <p>Once you’ve clicked on that.&#160; Finally, near the top left, beneath the logo you’ll see a place to install the app:</p>  <p><img style="display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" title="Installing XCode" alt="Installing Xcode" src="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/xcode-install.png" width="479" height="266" /></p>  <p>After that, follow the wizard and after a while, you’ll have Xcode installed.&#160; The only other factor you have to consider when you’re thinking about getting set up for development, is what kind of developer program account you want to have.&#160; </p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p><strong>Apple Developer Programs</strong></p>  <p>If nothing else, you should <a title="Apple Developer Registration" href="https://developer.apple.com/programs/register/">register as an Apple Developer</a>.&#160; This gets you access to samples, forums, WWDC videos, and many other resources.&#160; However, if you want to put apps in the app store (for iOS or OSX) or even put an app on a device, you’ll need to take a <a title="Apple Developer Programs" href="https://developer.apple.com/programs/which-program/">look at the “pay-to-play” developer programs</a>.&#160; There are four of these programs for iOS:</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <ul>   <li><strong>iOS Developer Program for Individuals - </strong>$99 a year for one individual developer license.&#160; This let’s you put apps into the iOS App Store.&#160; In addition, you can install apps to any device that has it’s Device ID registered in your developer portal.&#160; You can <a title="iOS Developer Program" href="https://developer.apple.com/programs/ios/">access this program here</a>. </li>    <li><strong>iOS Developer Program for Companies</strong> - $99 a year for a company with multiple developers.&#160; This let’s you put apps in the App Store and on devices just like the above individual program.&#160; The catch here is that your company needs to have a <a title="DUNS Number" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DUNS_NUMBER">DUNS number</a>.&#160; This is a way for Apple to make sure you’re really a company and not just some guy that’s going to sell developer access to other developers.&#160; One important thing to note is that when you have this program, all your apps are distributed under one entity in the app store.&#160; So if you make a fart app and a serious business app, they’ll be tied together in the App Store.&#160; You can <a title="iOS Developer Program for Companies" href="https://developer.apple.com/programs/ios/">access this program here</a>. </li>    <li><strong>iOS Developer Enterprise Program</strong> - $299 a year for a company with multiple developers.&#160; This program also requires the DUNS number mentioned above.&#160; This program is different from the ones above in that you don’t have the ability to distribute via the App Store.&#160; Instead, this program allows you to distribute apps to employees.&#160; Enrollment in this program opens up some options you don’t have with the above two (i.e. the device limits, testing installations, etc).&#160; You can <a title="iOS Developer Enterprise Program" href="https://developer.apple.com/programs/ios/enterprise/">access this program here</a>. </li>    <li><strong>iOS Developer University Program</strong> - This program is the only free one and is only available to qualifying higher education institutions.&#160; Chances are good if you’re reading this, you don’t qualify.&#160; However, if you work for a degree granting higher education institution, you can read <a title="iOS Developer University Program" href="https://developer.apple.com/programs/ios/university/">more about the program here</a>. </li>    <li><strong>Mac Developer Program</strong> - If you’re interested in distributing OSX apps in the Mac App Store, there is a individual and a company program for that as well.&#160; You can <a title="Mac Developer Program" href="https://developer.apple.com/programs/mac/">access this program here</a>. </li> </ul>  <p>When you enroll in one of these programs, you’ll tie your Apple ID to it.&#160; You will then be able to add development devices, generate a provisioning profile, create certificates, prepare apps for distribution, and finally move them into the App Store.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>  <p>Getting set up for iOS (and OSX) development is very easy.&#160; There is only one program to install (Xcode) and it comes with all the software you need out of the box.&#160; Joining a developer program is also relatively simple (and required if you want to put things on the App Store).&#160; In the proceeding articles in the series we’ll start diving into Xcode and making apps.&#160; </p>
