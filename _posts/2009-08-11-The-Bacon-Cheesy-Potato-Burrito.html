<p><img style="margin: 0px 10px 0px 0px" height="179" src="http://chrisrisner.com/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/Mmmmmmm.Bacon_8FF2/image_2.png" width="240" align="left" /> Well, I finally tried it.&#160; Two weeks ago, I was all set to be good and eat healthy for the week in between a trip to Phoenix and a house boat trip (story to come) when two friends from work suggest (FORCE!) we go to Taco Bell for lunch.&#160; Upon arriving at Taco Bell, I was assaulted by signs for the Bacon Cheesy Potato Burrito.&#160; Not only were there signs, but my two friends nearly demanded that I get the Bacon Cheesy Potato Burrito.&#160; So, I did what I had to do and got it.&#160; While I am a firm (giggity) believer that bacon makes everything better, there was not enough bacon in the bacon cheesy potato burrito.&#160; It was good, but had potential to be so much more.&#160; Now, if you're not &quot;that&quot; into bacon (a.k.a. a communist) then you probably won't dig this burrito.&#160; If however you think that a breakfast that comes with bacon could be improved by having more bacon, then run, don't walk, to your nearest taco bell.</p>  <p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> It's been brought to my attention that there's a bit of a contradiction here.&#160; I said that there isn't enough bacon but that if you don't like bacon you shouldn't try this.&#160; This is not a contradiction but a further emphasis on my love of bacon and more of it.&#160; Thank you.</p>
