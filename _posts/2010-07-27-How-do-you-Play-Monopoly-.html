<p><a onclick="return hs.expand(this)" class="highslide" href="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/MonopolyGuy.jpg"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 10px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="Monopoly Guy" border="0" alt="Monopoly Guy" align="right" src="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/MonopolyGuy.jpg" width="244" height="225" /></a> Last week a friend of mine from Arizona was visiting Michigan and had we had a chance to hang out with him for a couple of nights.&#160; While he was here, he purchased for Erin and I our first edition of Monopoly.&#160; Erin and I have of course played before but WE have never owned it.&#160; Having few people willing to play the fast-paced property-trading game in the overly warm state of Arizona, he relished the opportunity to sucker Erin and I into a game (or two).&#160; After purchasing a copy from the local store, we got everything out and started playing.&#160; I quickly learned that there are a couple rules that he is use to that I wasn’t.&#160; </p>  <p>First and foremost, he doesn’t put any money in the middle.&#160; <strong>No $500 to start and no tax money or money from Chance or Community Chest.</strong>&#160; Growing up, I always put a fresh $500 in there and replaced that every time someone landed on Free Parking (who then took all the money).&#160; I was ok with this one but the next one was just ridiculous.&#160; <strong>If you have multiple railroads and someone lands on one of them, even if the others are mortgaged, you still collect the amount for having that many railroads.</strong>&#160; This is just crazy.&#160; He was pretty adamant that this was “the rule” but I had to overrule and call a “House Rule” to block him.&#160; In my mind, if you have two railroads and someone lands on one, they owe you $50.&#160; If however, the other railroad is mortgaged, it’s $25.&#160; Period.&#160; There’s no way around this one.&#160; Thankfully, <a title="Monopoly Rules" href="http://www.hasbro.com/common/instruct/monins.pdf">Hasbro’s official rules agree with me</a>!&#160; </p>  <p>So the question is, how do you play Monopoly?&#160; Are there any weird rules you follow in your house?&#160; Any idea why you have these rules? </p>
