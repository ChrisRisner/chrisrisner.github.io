<p>For the past year, I've been trying to exercise and lose weight pretty consistently.&#160; I've made some pretty good strides during that time including the following:</p>  <ul>   <li>Losing 40 pounds.</li>    <li>Building a good amount of muscle mass.</li>    <li>Building up my endurance.</li>    <li>Ran a <a href="http://www.martianmarathon.com/results/halfoverall09.htm">half marathon</a>.</li>    <li>Started swimming again.</li> </ul>  <p>A lot of this had to do with moving to Kalamazoo where I wasn't quite as distracted by going out and drinking every night.&#160; Now that I've moved back to the Metro Detroit area I'm a bit more distracted (I've got stuff going on the next two nights before going up north for the weekend).&#160; However, I've been able to work out during lunch since work seems to be ok with it.&#160; All in all despite going out more I've been making it to the gym and eating pretty consistently every week (with some notable exceptions).&#160; One thing I find very useful during this time is keeping track of what I do.&#160; I don't really count calories like many people on diets do and insist that I stay beneath a certain number, but getting the numbers for everything really helps you remember what's good for you to eat and what's very bad for you.&#160; One tool I've been using is <a href="http://www.myfitnesspal.com">myfitnesspal.com</a> which makes it very easy to keep track of everything you eat.&#160; You basically go in and add what you eat and drink for each day.&#160; Here's an example of what I ate today:</p>  <p><a onclick="return hs.expand(this)" class="highslide" href="http://chrisrisner.com/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/EatingHealthyoratLeastTryingTo_139D8/image_2.png"><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="220" alt="image" src="http://chrisrisner.com/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/EatingHealthyoratLeastTryingTo_139D8/image_thumb.png" width="244" align="left" border="0" /></a> </p>  <p>You'll note that it allows me to split things up into different &quot;meals&quot;.&#160; In addition when you click on the &quot;Add Food&quot; link, it remembers the things you've eaten for that meal before.&#160; Also, you can search for previously entered food items (in fact I haven't had to enter a single new thing in their site, everything I've eaten or drank was already there).&#160; While it obviously allows you to keep track and &quot;count&quot; calories, as well as several other things (protein, fat, carbs, sugar, sodium, etc).&#160; Another portion of the site also allows you to enter your work outs.&#160; When you generate your account you basically put in your current weight and what your goal is as well as how often you work out each week.&#160; It will then tell you how much you should eat to achieve your goal in the timeline you've chosen.&#160; So if you're interested in keeping track of what you're eating and really being held accountable, I'd suggest giving it a try.&#160; I'd definitely throw some props to my friend Kevin who pointed out this site to me.&#160; If you're interested in someone's journey to be a bit healthier, <a href="http://www.kevinprice.com">Kevin's blog</a> is a good site to read.</p>
