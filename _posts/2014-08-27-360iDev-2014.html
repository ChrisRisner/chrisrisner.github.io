<img title="360iDev" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px; display: inline" alt="360iDev" src="http://storage.chrisrisner.com/images/Logo360iDev.png" width="240" align="right" height="176" />  <p>Earlier this week I had the pleasure of attending and presenting at 360iDev in Denver, CO.&#160; This was the first time I’ve been to an event in downtown Denver and really the first time I’ve spent more than a few hours in Denver at all.&#160; The conference was really great and being in the city was a fantastic experience.&#160; The only thing that wasn’t great were typical conference issues of projectors with too low of a resolution and bad wifi.&#160; Thankfully I think I got past these two issues enough to deliver my two presentations.&#160; You can read about those presentations and grab the slides for them below:</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p><strong>Building Connected iOS Apps with Mobile Services</strong></p>  <p><a href="http://storage.chrisrisner.com/presentations/360idevBuildingConnectediOSApps.pptx">Slides</a></p>  <p>This session covered how you can build iOS applications using <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/mobile">Azure Mobile Services</a>.&#160; Mobile Services provides a convenient way to store data, authenticate users, provide push notifications, backend logic, processed jobs and much more.&#160; </p>  <p><strong>Pushing to All the iPhones with Azure</strong></p>  <p><a href="http://storage.chrisrisner.com/presentations/360idevPushingToAllTheiPhones.pptx">Slides</a></p>  <p>This session went through how developers can use <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/services/notification-hubs/">Azure Notification Hubs</a> to handling push notifications with iOS apps.&#160; Notification Hubs provides a ton of push related functionality including broadcasts, targeted pushes, as well as easy cross-platform pushes in a super scalable way.</p>  <p>   <br />I hope to return and spend more time in Denver in the future.&#160; Whenever I do, I’ll be sure to make a return trip to <a href="http://thesqueakybean.net/">The Squeaky Bean</a> (and you should go there too)!</p>
