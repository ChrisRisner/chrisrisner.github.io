<p>My “friendly” neighbor <a href="http://atomicinternet.homeip.net/">Atomic</a> has what he calls a <a href="http://atomicinternet.homeip.net/webcam/">gnome cam</a>.&#160; It’s quite simply an all weather web cam that sits outside his front door snapping pictures every few minutes.&#160; On occasion the camera catches something interesting (see below) but usually the camera only captures images of a boring driveway.&#160; Now the problem with the gnome cam is that, while pointed directly at my house, it fails to get any helpful images of my house.&#160; If Atomic’s camera was better, we could see both of our boring driveways and the count of interesting occurrences would at least double.&#160; When I moved back into my cave, he didn’t exactly say he was going to get a newer and better camera, but I’m pretty sure he thought it to himself.&#160; So in response to his <a href="http://atomicinternet.homeip.net/news.asp?startat=article&amp;article=1005">assurance that I’m a lazy Morlock that doesn’t eat enough Eloi</a>, I say, when you have a camera that allows me to more easily see the Eloi as they travel around the cave’s entrance, I’ll chow down.</p>  <p><a onclick="return hs.expand(this)" class="highslide" href="http://chrisrisner.com/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/IneffectiveAtomicandHisIneffectiveGnomeC_C702/image_4.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://chrisrisner.com/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/IneffectiveAtomicandHisIneffectiveGnomeC_C702/image_thumb_1.png" width="244" height="186" /></a></p>
