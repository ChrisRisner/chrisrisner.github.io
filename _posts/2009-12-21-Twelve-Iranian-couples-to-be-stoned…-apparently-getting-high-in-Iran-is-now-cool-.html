<p>   <p><i></i></p> Iran's “moral” police have arrested a dozen couples for engaging in illicit sexual acts, including swapping partners, the conservative <i>Jomhuri Eslami</i> reported on Monday.&#160; (My guess is anything other than the missionary position is considered illicit/illegal in Iran.)&#160;&#160; </p>  <p>The report said the couples and another individual were running a website, Iran Multiplication, which was aimed at promoting illicit sexual relations. (<a href="http://www.persian-swingers.com">www.persian-swingers.com</a>, or <a href="http://www.persian-goats.com">www.persian-goats.com</a>)</p>  <p>The couples were said to have carried out sexual acts in the presence of each other and several times with multiple partners, the report added.</p>  <p>Those arrested held university degrees, while some were government employees and had children. (Some were even considered to be BIG fans of Oprah.)</p>  <p>The newspaper gave no further details about their identities or when or where they were arrested nor what their favorite sammiches are.&#160; (I’m guessing falafel though.)</p>  <p>Extra-marital sex is illegal in Iran where Islamic sharia law is the principal source of legislation. If found guilty of adultery, those arrested in the crackdown face being stoned to death.&#160; (Man these cats really need to chill out. They’re worse than people from the bible-belt)&#160;&#160;&#160; </p>  <p>Reports of partner swapping are a rarity in conservative Iran, but in March the elite Revolutionary Guards said it had launched a crackdown on several groups who had set up anti-Islamic and pornographic internet sites.</p>  <p>The Guards, set up to defend the ideals of the Islamic republic, said they had &quot;dismantled several networks (with rocks and hammers) that had set up anti-religious, anti-revolution and obscene internet sites&quot;.&#160; “We cannot and will not tolerate any nude photos of Lindsey Lohan on the intraweb in our country” advised Moustfa “Roger” El Cus Cus, Minister of Pain (and lunchables) for The Guards. </p>  <p>Among those also targeted are people deemed to be Satan worshippers as well as Cleveland Browns fans, while moral police often also carry out raids on concerts and parties as part of their tough crackdown on &quot;un-Islamic&quot; attire and behavior.&#160; (Good thing these effer’s don’t have Wal-Mart in their country yet – they’d have a field day)</p>  <p>No lunch meats were harmed for this report.&#160;&#160; <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/world/strangebuttrue/illicit-sex-12-couples-arrested-for-partner-swapping-20091124-j9dz.html" target="_blank">(Original story found here)</a></p>  <p><a onclick="return hs.expand(this)" class="highslide" href="http://sammichnow.com/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/Twe.apparentlygettinghighinIranisnowcool_11266/image_2.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://sammichnow.com/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/Twe.apparentlygettinghighinIranisnowcool_11266/image_thumb.png" width="147" height="169" /></a>     <br />“Pass the J mutha fucka”</p>
