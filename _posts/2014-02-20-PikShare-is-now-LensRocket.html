<p><img title="LensRocket icon" style="float: right; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; display: inline" alt="LensRocket icon" src="https://crcomcstorage.blob.core.windows.net/images/lensrocketicon512.png" width="264" align="right" height="264" />A little bit over a month ago, I released the source code for an application known as PikShare.&#160; Due to some naming issues, the app needed to be renamed and today that work is finally done.&#160; PikShare will forever more be known as <a title="LensRocket" href="http://chrisrisner.com/LensRocket--A-Photo-and-Video-Sharing-App-Built-with-Windows-Azure">LensRocket</a>.&#160; All existing links, URLs, and blog posts have been renamed to reflect this.&#160; However, all of the existing links will still work (via 302 redirects).&#160; Additionally, the <a title="LensRocket on GitHub" href="https://github.com/WindowsAzure-Samples/Android-LensRocket">GitHub repository for LensRocket</a> has been renamed to reflect the change.&#160; If you were already following or cloned the repo, GitHub automatically takes care of things for you so you won’t even notice the change.&#160; </p>  <p>Obviously all of the references in the code base now point to LensRocket as well.&#160; Included in that were a few changes to no longer use the term “pik” but instead “rocket”.&#160; Due to this change, the server side scripts also changed to reflect this.&#160; On the plus side of all this, if you had already started looking at PikShare, you don’t really need to do a lot to adjust to the new naming.&#160; </p>  <p>Lastly, instead of just changing the name, we also got a bit of design work done.&#160; Now I haven’t made the app look 100% like the design comps (yet) but it certainly looks a good deal better than it was before (and doesn’t look like a total clone of the app this was based off of).&#160; I invite you to take a look at the <a title="Android LensRocket" href="https://github.com/WindowsAzure-Samples/Android-LensRocket">source code</a>, play with the app, and let me know what you think.</p>
