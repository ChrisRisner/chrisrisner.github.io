<p><img style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; display: inline; float: right" align="right" src="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/GoogleIO.jpg" />Today at right around 12:30 pm EST, Google opened registration for it’s <a title="Google IO" href="http://www.google.com/events/io/2011/">Google IO conference</a>.&#160; And havoc ensued.&#160; Though I’m not sure how many seats they had available or how many they had in past years, I was fairly confident from the online hype that the conference wouldn’t take too long to sell out.&#160; That being said, who could have predicted that it would sell out in an hour (sort of).&#160; In addition to myself, 2 other people from work were planning to attend.&#160; We were waiting on other people to decide how we were going to register and they were a little slow with figuring things out.&#160; When the registration web site was coming back with Sold Out in just over an hour, I was floored.&#160; Floored and pissed that I wasn’t going to be able to go.&#160; Thanks to paying attention to Twitter though, I saw people talking about how they were getting assigned a key when they went into registration and if they found it they could go back in later and still register.&#160; It would seem that as soon as you got into the second page of registration, a key was assigned to your browser which didn’t get released later.&#160; So even though the site was saying the tickets were sold out, people were still getting into register if they’d been into the site earlier.&#160; Thankfully, when registration first opened, I went through the first page to check things out.&#160; After looking through my browser history, I found the registration link with my key and was able to get in.&#160; I won’t be going with any coworkers, but at least I’ll be going.&#160; There are a bunch of good Android sessions and some HTML5 ones as well.&#160; Any good ideas for things to do while in San Francisco?</p>
