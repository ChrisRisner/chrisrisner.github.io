<p><a onclick="return hs.expand(this)" class="highslide" href="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/633986486517724225.jpg"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 10px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="POOP!" border="0" alt="Poop" align="right" src="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/633986486517724225.jpg" width="161" height="67" /></a> After my last post regarding Exchange, my brother contacted me saying he was less than satisfied with my site’s content.&#160; Specifically the Exchange post.&#160; I immediately knew that my site needed more poop jokes to keep him entertained.&#160; However, putting nothing but poop jokes here would be a violation of my resolution to put more technical stuff on this site.&#160; So, I came up with a solution that would work for everyone.&#160; As my brother gets the content on my site like everyone else, from an RSS reader, what I really needed was a feed that wouldn’t give him anything he didn’t want to see.&#160; So I created the ability to exclude certain categories from the rss feed you pull from my site.&#160; Allow me to demonstrate.&#160; The RSS feed at the right is coming from my feedburner rss feed.&#160; However, this will get all the entries regardless of the content.&#160; So if you wanted an rss feed that would get you non-techy stuff, you’d use the following url: <a title="http://chrisrisner.com/syndication/rss.aspx?excludeCats=10+11+20" href="http://chrisrisner.com/syndication/rss.aspx?excludeCats=10+11+20">http://chrisrisner.com/syndication/rss.aspx?excludeCats=10+11+20</a>.&#160; That url will get you all entries that aren’t tagged as programming, .net, or exchange related.&#160; The “non-techy” url will likely change if I keep posting other technical stuff to the site, but for now, rest assured that if you put that url in your feed reader, you’ll be basking in the glory of poop jokes in no time.&#160; Now, without further ado, <a href="http://www.bathroomjokes.com/poop/index.htm">poop jokes</a>.</p>
