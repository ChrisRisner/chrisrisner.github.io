<p><img style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; display: inline; float: right" title="Windows Azure Mobile Services" alt="Windows Azure Mobile Services" align="right" src="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/mobile-service-logo-3.png" />I’m extremely excited today because we just launched the first version of <a title="Mobile Services" href="https://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/mobile/">Windows Azure Mobile Services</a>.&#160; Mobile Services is a new offering from Windows Azure which is designed to help you get a backend up and running for your mobile apps in the blink of an eye (ok more like 3 or 4 blinks, but super fast).&#160; Out of the box, it has support for Windows 8, but as you can see if you take a look at the first slide on the <a title="Mobile Services" href="https://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/mobile/">Mobile Services home page</a>, support for iOS, Android, and Windows Phone is in the pipeline.&#160; I’ll be posting a lot more information about Mobile Services in the near future, but let’s go over the basics.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p><strong>What is it?</strong></p>  <p>Mobile services is a new backend as a service offering built off of the power of Windows Azure.&#160; This means it is ideal for mobile application development because there is very minimal work you HAVE to do on the backend to get things running.&#160; Once you’ve created a mobile service, you create new database tables (you don’t have to specify columns or data types, just table names).&#160; From there, you can start making HTTP calls to your backend and inserting data (it’s nearly as easy as saying “insert X, Y, Z into table A”.&#160; Mobile Services will figure out the schema for you!&#160; Out of the box you’ll also be able to use authentication with Microsoft (Live) accounts.&#160; Finally, push notifications work out of the box so you can communicate from your Mobile Services backend with your apps.&#160; </p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p><strong>Is that all?</strong></p>  <p>No, not even remotely.&#160; In addition to having a dynamic schema on the backend, you’re able to write server side scripts.&#160; You can think of this as a sort of code injection.&#160; You’re able to execute (server side javascript) code on any sort of table access (insert, update, delete, and reads).&#160; These scripts could do things like validate data, alter queries (i.e. ensure you’re only selecting rows the calling user has access to), send a push notification to anyone affected by the data update, and many other things.</p>  <p>&#160; </p>  <p><strong></strong></p>  <p><strong>What about that scaling stuff?</strong></p>  <p>Let’s say you make a new app today and then in a month, it blows up <a title="Gangnam Style" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bZkp7q19f0">Gangnam style</a>, what do you do?&#160; Thankfully, it’s as easy as going to the Windows Azure portal, opening your Mobile Service, going to Scale, and sliding a slider to increase the number of shared instances or to upgrade to a reserved instance.&#160; Now, when you sign up, the services you create are shared instances and are free.&#160; When you scale up, that will start accruing a cost.&#160; However, you can get a fair amount of use out of the free instance.&#160; In addition, you get 10 free instances.&#160; That’s a lot of room to play around with different mobile apps.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p><strong>But what does this have to do with iOS and Android?</strong></p>  <p>Well, as I said above, as part of the announcement, the Mobile Services team has said that iOS, Android, and Windows Phone support is coming soon.&#160; However, that doesn’t mean you can’t use it right now!&#160; All of the calls to Mobile Services are HTTP based and send JSON across the wire.&#160; These are two things that both iOS and Android are more than capable of.&#160; So, while there may not be an official SDK and only Microsoft account authentication and Windows 8 push notifications are available today, there are still some tremendous capabilities you can take advantage of in the data arena.&#160; Over the next few weeks, I’ll be posting more samples on how you can do this.&#160; </p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p><strong>How do I try this out?</strong></p>  <p>You can try out mobile services (whether you want to make a Windows 8 app or figure out how to connect iOS or Android) right now.&#160; <a title="Free Windows Azure Three Month Trial" href="http://aka.ms/al45am">Sign up for a free three month Windows Azure trial here</a> and then request access to the Mobile Services preview feature.&#160; If you start playing with Mobile Services, I’d love to hear from you.&#160; Whether it’s questions about how to do something or a story about an app you’ve built.&#160; </p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p><strong>Let’s go to the video</strong></p>  <p>There is a great video up on Channel 9 of Scott Guthrie demonstrating Windows Azure Mobile Services.&#160; Here it is if you’d like to watch.   <br /><iframe style="width: 512px; height: 288px" src="http://channel9.msdn.com/posts/Introduction-to-Windows-Azure-Mobile-Services/player?w=512&amp;h=288" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
