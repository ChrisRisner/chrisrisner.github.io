<p>As I did at the beginning of 2013, I’d like to take a moment to look back at the last year and reflect on a few of the things that happened as well as go over some stats from my site.</p>  <p><strong>Highlights of 2013</strong></p>  <p>Last year was definitely a bit more exciting than anything that happened in 2013 but when you change jobs, get married, and move across the country, it’s tough to match that.&#160; Last year I listed out each month and something important that occurred within that month.&#160; I don’t really feel like there was enough big stuff to do that again but we’ll just do it anyway.</p>  <ul>   <li><strong>January</strong> Nothing exciting here.&#160; I did get approval for <a title="GOES" href="http://www.globalentry.gov/">Global Entry</a> and <a title="TSA PreCheck" href="http://www.tsa.gov/tsa-precheck">TSA Pre-Check</a>.&#160; If you are a frequent traveler (on airplanes that is) I can’t recommend Pre-Check enough.&#160; I’ve walked in the airport and been through security within two minutes countless times. </li>    <li><strong>February</strong> Nothing crazy here either.&#160; I spoke at a few conferences and visited a company in Toronto. </li>    <li><strong>March</strong> Nothing worth mentioning. </li>    <li><strong>April</strong> Erin and I visited Portland for the first time.&#160; It was a lot of fun though I think the city get’s hyped up a bit too much.&#160; </li>    <li><strong>May</strong> Went to a few conferences.&#160; Went <a title="Kayaking in Lake Union" href="https://plus.google.com/+ChrisRisner/posts/8mMXa8gXrEC">kayaking in Lake Union</a> for the first time.&#160; We had so much fun we went back about half a dozen times, including once with my brother, and just bought our first kayak so we can go anytime we want next summer.&#160; I also earned my motorcycle license endorsement. </li>    <li><strong>June</strong> Spoke at a few different conferences including TechEd in New Orleans and Build in San Francisco.&#160; We also travelled back to the midwest for one of my best friends’ weddings in Chicago. </li>    <li><strong>July</strong> Nothing amazing.&#160; We did rent a jetski in Lake Washington which was a lot of fun.&#160; It’s expensive for an hour of fun but is a pretty cool way to see the lake. </li>    <li><strong>August</strong> Nothing fun. </li>    <li><strong>September</strong> Spent a weekend in Eastern Washington for my birthday.&#160; We actually stayed on a functioning wine vineyard which was a lot of fun. </li>    <li><strong>October </strong>We went to <a title="Seattle Secret Supper" href="http://www.seattlemet.com/events/secret-supper-september-2013">Seattle Met’s Secret Supper</a>.&#160; This was a meal at the number one restaurant of the year for Seattle Met magazine.&#160; They didn’t tell people that had purchased tickets where it was until the morning of the dinner.&#160; It ended up being at <a title="Mamnoon" href="http://www.mamnoonrestaurant.com/">Mamnoon</a> and it was great. </li>    <li><strong>November </strong>Did some travel for work and went back to the midwest for Thanksgiving.&#160; This was my first time back since my family moved out of the house I spent most of my life in. </li>    <li><strong>December </strong>Just the usual busyness of the holidays as well as wrapping up the <a href="http://chrisrisner.com/LensRocket--A-Photo-and-Video-Sharing-App-Built-with-Windows-Azure">LensRocket</a> demo I just released.</li> </ul>  <p><strong>Top 3 blog posts</strong></p>  <p>By looking at unique view count, these were the top three blog posts in 2012:</p>  <ul>   <li><a title="Writing and reading files with Android" href="http://chrisrisner.com/31-Days-of-Android--Day-23%E2%80%93Writing-and-Reading-Files">Writing and Reading Files with Android</a> – This was actually in the top 3 last year as well. </li>    <li><a title="Multiple View Controllers and Storyboards in iOS" href="http://chrisrisner.com/31-Days-of-iOS--Day-4%E2%80%93Working-with-Multiple-View-Controllers-and-Storyboards">Working with Multiple View Controllers and Storyboards in iOS</a> </li>    <li><a title="31 Days of Android" href="http://chrisrisner.com/31-Days-of-Android">31 Days of Android</a> – Also in the top 3 from last year. </li> </ul>  <p>While not in the top 3, the <a title="31 Days of iOS" href="http://chrisrisner.com/31-Days-of-iOS">31 Day series on iOS development</a> was number 6.&#160; In total there were 5 articles from that series in the top 10 list.</p>  <p><strong>Top Azure Post</strong></p>  <p>The number one Azure post, by unique viewer count, was my <a title="Common Scenarios with Azure Mobile Services" href="http://chrisrisner.com/Common-Scenarios-with-Windows-Azure-Mobile-Services">Common Scenarios with Windows Azure Mobile Services post</a>.&#160; This post contains links to tons of different tutorials and blog posts about using Mobile Services.</p>  <p><strong>The Visitors</strong></p>  <p>Here are the stats on the people that visited the site:</p>  <ul>   <li><strong>Unique Visitors </strong>There were 126,472 unique visitors on the site.&#160; This is over 2.5 times what I had last year. </li>    <li><strong>Visits</strong> There were 196,845 visits to the site. </li>    <li><strong>Page Views</strong> There were 415,748 page views which means there was on average 2.11 pages per visit. </li>    <li><strong>Location and Language </strong>The United States led with the most visitors (42k), followed by India (34k) and then the UK (9k).&#160; English was the language of choice.&#160; </li>    <li><strong>Browser and OS</strong> Over half the traffic (51.51%) was from Chrome (a small increase over last year) then Safari (20.04%) and then Firefox (18.10%) and finally IE (6.10%).&#160; This was a big increase for Safari and a moderate decrease for IE.&#160; For OS, Windows led (48.6%) then Macintosh (39.34%), then iOS (4.76%), then Linux (4.73%) and finally Android (2.13%).&#160; This showed an increase in Mac at the cost of Windows.&#160; Interestingly, there has been a lot of coverage about the sale of Chromebooks over the last year and it’s traffic is at 0.01% (27 total visits). </li>    <li><strong>Mobile</strong> Mobile traffic was up at 7.2% (including both phones and tablets) with the iPad leading the iPhone (5312 and 3929).&#160; The next closest defined device (there was a “non set” in between) was the Nexus 7 with 332 visits. </li>    <li><strong>Where you came from</strong> Once again people overwhelmingly came from Google (151,341) then direct (29,147), and finally Twitter (3,339).&#160; </li> </ul>  <p>As mentioned above, this was a huge increase over last year.&#160; Daily visits started off this year around the 200 – 400 per day range and ended at the 400 – 900 per day range.&#160; It’s really awesome to see the site being visited so much more in just a year’s time and to see how that growth looks for different operating systems / browsers.&#160; </p>  <p><strong>What’s ahead in 2014</strong></p>  <p>I’ve got a number of things planned for this year including:</p>  <ul>   <li>Doubling the traffic on this site If the same level of growth occurs over the next year that I had in this year, this should be pretty easy to accomplish.</li>    <li>I’d like to get back into doing more fitness type things so I’d like to run a half marathon by the end of the year (I’m already planning a <a href="http://www.hotchocolate15k.com/seattle/">15k in March</a>).</li>    <li>I received a FitBit in September and have <a title="Getting fitibit totals" href="http://haacked.com/archive/2014/01/02/fitbit-step-totals/">since walked</a> just over 1 million steps.&#160; If you calculate it out that means 3.38 millions steps in 2014.&#160; I’d like to hit 5 million.</li>    <li>I want to release the finished Android <a title="LensRocket for Android" href="http://chrisrisner.com/LensRocket--A-Photo-and-Video-Sharing-App-Built-with-Windows-Azure">LensRocket</a> app to the Google Play Store as well as finish the iOS version and release that to the App Store.</li>    <li>I’ve been getting back into game development and would like to release at least one game to an app store as well as participate in one of the <a title="Ludum Dare" href="http://www.ludumdare.com/">Ludum Dares</a>.</li>    <li>I’m doing a lot of travel this year for non-work reasons and those are going to be some great trips: Europe, Alaska, Phoenix.</li> </ul>  <p>I’ll be back for another report in 2015.</p>
