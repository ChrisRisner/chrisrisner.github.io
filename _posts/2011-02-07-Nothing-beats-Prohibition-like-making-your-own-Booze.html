<p><img style="margin: 0px 0px 4px 5px; display: inline; float: right" align="right" src="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/GeorgeWhoreHay.jpg" />Erin and I are having a little get together in a couple weeks to celebrate our engagement (oh yeah, that happened) and my friend at work, George, offered to help me brew a batch of beer for the party.&#160; George (pronounced “Whore Hay”) is to home brewing what I am to home drinking.&#160; He knows more than I can ever hope to learn about brewing and it was a very educational experience spending the day freezing our asses off in his garage.&#160; </p>  <p>Prior to meeting up, George asked what kind of beer I wanted to make.&#160; Having recently tasted Sierra Nevada’s fantastic holiday beer, <a title="Celebration Ale" href="http://www.sierranevada.com/beers/celebrationale.html">Celebration Ale</a>, I thought it would be a great beer to make.&#160; Fortunately, George actually found the EXACT recipe for the beer given by the <a title="Brewing Network Podcast" href="http://thebrewingnetwork.com/shows/660">Sierra Nevada brewers in a podcast</a>.&#160; After a quick trip to the <a title="Adventures in Home Brewing" href="http://www.homebrewing.org/">Adventures in Home Brewing</a> store in Taylor, we had all the ingredients we needed.</p>  <p>In order to brew the beer, we first had to <a title="Heating the Water" href="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/HeatingThe Water.jpg">heat the water using a propane powered burner</a>.&#160; After that, we <a title="Mixing the Grains" href="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/Mixing the Grain.jpg">mixed the hot water with the grains</a> in a cooler (the yellow one) we picked up from the store.&#160; We then had to let that sit for about an hour.&#160; During that time we set up another cooler (the blue one) with hot water.&#160; When the grains had sat for quite a while, we elaborately <a title="Putting the Beer in the Kettle" href="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/PuttingTheBeerInTheKettle.jpg">siphoned the grain soaked water (with all the sugar in it) back into the kettle</a>.&#160; At the same time <img style="margin: 5px 5px 5px 0px; display: inline; float: left" align="left" src="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/PrimaryFermenter.jpg" width="189" height="336" />we were siphoning water from the blue cooler into the yellow cooler.&#160; This enabled us to get both the proper amount of water into the kettle and helped us get more sugar into the kettle (the sugar is what turns into alcohol).&#160; While the water (beer) was getting back into the kettle, we <a title="More Hops" href="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/BeerAndHops.jpg">put in some more hops</a> to add to the flavor.&#160; After allowing it to boil for about an hour and mixing in more hops, we then <a title="Putting the Beer in the Carboy" href="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/PuttingTheBeerInTheCarBoy.jpg">siphoned the beer into the carboy for it to ferment</a> and added the yeast.&#160; Finally, with all that done, we put the <a title="Fermenting Fermenter" href="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/PrimaryFermenter.jpg">carboy (the primary fermenter) into the basement for fermenting</a>.&#160;&#160; In about a week, George will move it to a secondary fermenter, and then a few weeks later to a keg for consumption.&#160; As I was running late to get home, George was even kind enough to clean up so I could hit the very snowy road.&#160; Clearly I owe him a large bottle of the first beer I brew at home (when I get to some home brewing).&#160; </p>  <p>Things are slightly more complex than that and would require a lot more explanation than you have time for.&#160; Plus there’s a good amount of chemistry to it.&#160; You don’t really have to understand 100% of it to homebrew yourself, but it’s all very interesting to learn.&#160; Most importantly, the payoff is more beer.</p>
