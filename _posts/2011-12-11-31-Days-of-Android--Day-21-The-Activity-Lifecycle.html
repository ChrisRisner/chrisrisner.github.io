<p><img style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; display: inline; float: right" align="right" src="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/android-200.png" />Today as we continue the <a title="31 Days of Android" href="http://chrisrisner.com/31-Days-of-Android">31 Days of Android</a>, we’ll talk about the <strong>Activity</strong> lifecycle.&#160; Activities are the way in which users interact with your application.&#160; Whenever you run an app, it’s an activity presenting something to you via the screen.&#160; Activities function as the back end and controlling logic of everything you can do on screen.&#160; Since activities are such an important part of an Android application, it’s very important that you understand the <strong>Activity</strong> lifecycle.&#160; An application is typically built off of multiple such activities but it is possible that an app can run with only a single <strong>Activity</strong>.&#160; </p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p><strong>Different Activity States</strong></p>  <p>While you might assume an <strong>Activity</strong> has two states, visible or not, there are more that you need to consider.&#160; First an <strong>Activity</strong> can be in the creation state and not yet visible.&#160; Secondly, it could be visible and currently interacted with by the user.&#160; Next, the activity could be paused, which means that it is partially visible but without focus.&#160; When the activity is fully obscured, such as when another activity launches or when the user taps home, it is stopped.&#160; Lastly, it can be in a shut down phase when it’s being removed from the stack.&#160; Speaking of stack, it’s useful to think of activities like a deck of cards (<a title="Activities like a stack of cards" href="http://chrisrisner.com/31-Days-of-Android--Day-5%E2%80%93Adding-Multiple-Activities-and-using-Intents">as mentioned in day 5</a>).&#160; At the bottom of that deck is the home screen which can never be taken off the stack.&#160; When you start your application, the first activity is put on top of the home screen.&#160; Whenever you call <strong>finish()</strong> in an activity it is taken off the stack.&#160; Whenever you start a new activity, it’s placed on the top of the stack.&#160; So if you had started 5 activities, the user could hit the back button to go down the stack of cards.</p>  <p><strong></strong></p>  <p><strong>The State Diagram</strong></p>  <p>When discussing the different states of an Android app, it’s useful to look at this diagram put together by Google:</p>  <p><img style="display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" src="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/android_activity_lifecycle.png" width="451" height="588" /></p>  <p>Each of the ovals (<strong>Activity starts, Activity is running, Activity is shut down, Process is killed</strong>) represent important states that an activity can be in.&#160; More important, each of the rectangular boxes (<strong>onCreate</strong>, <strong>onStart</strong>, <strong>onResume</strong>, <strong>onPause</strong>, <strong>onStop</strong>, <strong>onRecreate</strong>, <strong>onDestroy</strong>) represent methods that are called on your application during the state flow.&#160; So far in this series, all of the logic we’ve done for altering the layout or adding click listeners has been in the <strong>onCreate</strong> method.&#160; Looking at these may be a little confusing so we’ll try to break it down:</p>  <p><strong>onCreate</strong>-called once on activity creation.</p>  <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <strong>onStart</strong>-called whenever the activity is started (partially visible to the user) and anytime the activity is brought back into view after a call to <strong>onStop</strong>.&#160; Can be called multiple times.</p>  <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <strong>onResume</strong>-called when the activity is in the forefront on top of all others.&#160; Can be called multiple times.</p>  <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <strong>onPause</strong>-called when the activity leaves the foreground but is still visible, or when the device goes to sleep.&#160; Can be called multiple times.</p>  <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <strong>onStop</strong>-called whenever the activity is hidden from view.&#160; Can be called multiple times.</p>  <p><strong>onDestroy</strong>-the activity should release all of it’s resources and stop any background proccessing.&#160; Only called once.</p>  <p>Hopefully this explains why most of the logic added and layout alteration is done in <strong>onCreate</strong>.&#160; That is called once and the activity is kept in memory so you shouldn’t need to specify click listeners or perform other <strong>onCreate</strong> common functionality elsewhere.&#160; In comparison, <strong>onStart</strong> and <strong>onResume</strong> may be called multiple times.&#160; Furthermore, <strong>onResume</strong> will be called the first time your activity becomes visible, even though that may not make sense considering the name.&#160; </p>  <p>It’s important to know that after any of an activity’s <strong>onPause</strong>, <strong>onStop</strong>, or <strong>onDestroy</strong> methods are called it is possible for the Dalvik Virtual Machine that runs all of the Android apps to kill your app without calling into any of the other methods in the status flow.&#160; While it’s therefore important to persist any necessary data in the <strong>onPause </strong>method, be warned that starting the next activity will wait until the call to <strong>onPause</strong> is returned.&#160; </p>  <p>Another thing that may not make sense initially is that when the device is rotated, the <strong>Activity</strong> is killed and recreated.&#160; This is really hard for some new Android devs to grasp so I’ll say it again.&#160; When the device is rotated, the <strong>Activity is killed and recreated</strong>.&#160; If you think about the fact that different layouts can be used for different orientation this starts to make more sense.&#160; The important take away is that you need to make sure you test that changing orientation doesn’t screw up the state of your <strong>Activity</strong>.</p>  <p><strong></strong></p>  <p><strong>Saving and Restoring Activity State</strong></p>  <p>Whenever an <strong>Activity</strong> is paused or stopped, it’s state is retained.&#160; This is done automatically and something you don’t have to worry about.&#160; However, when an <strong>Activity</strong> is destroyed, things can be a little different.&#160; Before <strong>onStop</strong> is called (and possible before <strong>onPause</strong>) the <strong>Activitiy</strong>’s <strong>onSaveInstanceState </strong>method will be called.&#160; This method takes in a <strong>Bundle</strong> which you can add data to.&#160; This <strong>Bundle</strong> is then sent in to the <strong>onCreate</strong> method.&#160; If, in the <strong>onCreate</strong> method, the <strong>Bundle</strong> isn’t null then you know that the <strong>Activity</strong> is being recreated.&#160; Android’s default implementation of <strong>onSaveInstanceState</strong> already handles a lot of the persistence you might need.&#160; By default, it will call <strong>onSaveInstanceState</strong> on all of the views inside of it.&#160; So, for example if you’ve typed something into an <strong>EditText</strong> and then rotate the device, that text will appear after rotation as well.&#160; <strong>onSaveInstanceState</strong> saves the text value and then it gets restored in <strong>onCreate</strong>.&#160; It’s important to note that in order for this to work your <strong>View</strong>s must have a unique ID.</p>  <p>If your <strong>Activity </strong>has member variables that you need to save when the <strong>Activity</strong> is destroyed, then you would need to handle saving the state of these variables.&#160; This is one example of something that you could handle in <strong>onSaveInstanceState</strong>.&#160; Let’s say your <strong>Activity </strong>has a member variable named “<strong>Name</strong>” and you want to keep it’s value on recreation.&#160; You could add it to the <strong>Bundle </strong>like so:</p>  <div class="csharpcode">   <pre class="alt">@Override</pre>

  <pre><span class="kwrd">protected</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> onSaveInstanceState(Bundle outState) {</pre>

  <pre class="alt">    super.onSaveInstanceState(outState);</pre>

  <pre>    outState.putString(<span class="str">&quot;MyString&quot;</span>, <span class="kwrd">this</span>.Name);</pre>

  <pre class="alt">}</pre>
</div>
<style type="text/css">
.csharpcode, .csharpcode pre
{
	font-size: small;
	color: black;
	font-family: consolas, "Courier New", courier, monospace;
	background-color: #ffffff;
	/*white-space: pre;*/
}
.csharpcode pre { margin: 0em; }
.csharpcode .rem { color: #008000; }
.csharpcode .kwrd { color: #0000ff; }
.csharpcode .str { color: #006080; }
.csharpcode .op { color: #0000c0; }
.csharpcode .preproc { color: #cc6633; }
.csharpcode .asp { background-color: #ffff00; }
.csharpcode .html { color: #800000; }
.csharpcode .attr { color: #ff0000; }
.csharpcode .alt 
{
	background-color: #f4f4f4;
	width: 100%;
	margin: 0em;
}
.csharpcode .lnum { color: #606060; }</style>

<p>Then in your <strong>onCreate</strong> method, you can check and see if you have a <strong>savedInstanceState</strong> and set your variable if you do:</p>

<div class="csharpcode">
  <pre class="alt">@Override</pre>

  <pre><span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {</pre>

  <pre class="alt">    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);</pre>

  <pre>    </pre>

  <pre class="alt">    <span class="kwrd">if</span> (savedInstanceState != <span class="kwrd">null</span>) {</pre>

  <pre>        <span class="kwrd">this</span>.Name = savedInstanceState.getString(<span class="str">&quot;MyString&quot;</span>);</pre>

  <pre class="alt">    }</pre>

  <pre>    ...</pre>
</div>
<style type="text/css">
.csharpcode, .csharpcode pre
{
	font-size: small;
	color: black;
	font-family: consolas, "Courier New", courier, monospace;
	background-color: #ffffff;
	/*white-space: pre;*/
}
.csharpcode pre { margin: 0em; }
.csharpcode .rem { color: #008000; }
.csharpcode .kwrd { color: #0000ff; }
.csharpcode .str { color: #006080; }
.csharpcode .op { color: #0000c0; }
.csharpcode .preproc { color: #cc6633; }
.csharpcode .asp { background-color: #ffff00; }
.csharpcode .html { color: #800000; }
.csharpcode .attr { color: #ff0000; }
.csharpcode .alt 
{
	background-color: #f4f4f4;
	width: 100%;
	margin: 0em;
}
.csharpcode .lnum { color: #606060; }</style>

<p>One final note about <strong>onSaveInstanceState</strong> is that it won’t be called if the <strong>Activity</strong> is killed as a result of calling <strong>finish() </strong>or the user hitting the back button.&#160; Since these are deliberate causes for the <strong>Activity</strong> to be ended, there isn’t a reason to save the state.&#160; If you need to store any information when this happens, you’ll have to do it manually.</p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p><strong>Configuration changes</strong></p>

<p><strong></strong></p>

<p>The reason that your <strong>Activity</strong> is recreated when the orientation changes is that it is a change in the <strong>Resources.Configuration</strong> class.&#160; Any changes to this class will trigger a recreation.&#160; Other examples of things that change the <strong>Resources.Configuration</strong> class are sliding in or out a hardware keyboard (changing the input device), changing mode (i.e. night mode, car mode, etc), and more.&#160; The rotation and keyboard are likely to be the most common configuration changes you’ll need to handle.&#160; It is possible to override these changes, per <strong>Activity</strong>, so that you aren’t restarted.&#160; This is done by adding a <strong>configChanges</strong> to your <strong>Activity</strong> in the manifest file.&#160; For example, if you wanted to prevent restart on rotation for an <strong>Activity </strong>named <strong>ActivityTwo</strong>, you’d do the following:</p>

<div class="csharpcode">
  <pre class="alt"><span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">activity</span> <span class="attr">android:name</span><span class="kwrd">=&quot;.ActivityTwo&quot;</span> </pre>

  <pre>    <span class="attr">android:configChanges</span><span class="kwrd">=&quot;orientation&quot;</span></pre>

  <pre class="alt">    <span class="attr">android:label</span><span class="kwrd">=&quot;@string/app_name&quot;</span><span class="kwrd">/&gt;</span></pre>
</div>
<style type="text/css">
.csharpcode, .csharpcode pre
{
	font-size: small;
	color: black;
	font-family: consolas, "Courier New", courier, monospace;
	background-color: #ffffff;
	/*white-space: pre;*/
}
.csharpcode pre { margin: 0em; }
.csharpcode .rem { color: #008000; }
.csharpcode .kwrd { color: #0000ff; }
.csharpcode .str { color: #006080; }
.csharpcode .op { color: #0000c0; }
.csharpcode .preproc { color: #cc6633; }
.csharpcode .asp { background-color: #ffff00; }
.csharpcode .html { color: #800000; }
.csharpcode .attr { color: #ff0000; }
.csharpcode .alt 
{
	background-color: #f4f4f4;
	width: 100%;
	margin: 0em;
}
.csharpcode .lnum { color: #606060; }</style>

<p>Then in your <strong>Activity</strong> you would override the <strong>onConfigurationChanged</strong> method and just make it specify the orientation you want to maintain:</p>

<div class="csharpcode">
  <pre class="alt">@Override</pre>

  <pre><span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> onConfigurationChanged(Configuration newConfig) {</pre>

  <pre class="alt">    super.onConfigurationChanged(newConfig);</pre>

  <pre>    setRequestedOrientation(ActivityInfo.SCREEN_ORIENTATION_PORTRAIT);</pre>

  <pre class="alt">}</pre>
</div>
<style type="text/css">
.csharpcode, .csharpcode pre
{
	font-size: small;
	color: black;
	font-family: consolas, "Courier New", courier, monospace;
	background-color: #ffffff;
	/*white-space: pre;*/
}
.csharpcode pre { margin: 0em; }
.csharpcode .rem { color: #008000; }
.csharpcode .kwrd { color: #0000ff; }
.csharpcode .str { color: #006080; }
.csharpcode .op { color: #0000c0; }
.csharpcode .preproc { color: #cc6633; }
.csharpcode .asp { background-color: #ffff00; }
.csharpcode .html { color: #800000; }
.csharpcode .attr { color: #ff0000; }
.csharpcode .alt 
{
	background-color: #f4f4f4;
	width: 100%;
	margin: 0em;
}
.csharpcode .lnum { color: #606060; }</style>

<p>So here you’re saying to keep a portrait orientation even when the orientation may have been changed to landscape.</p>

<p>You should now have a good understanding of the <strong>Activity</strong> lifecycle now and when which event method are called.&#160; One thing we didn’t cover is how to persist data long term so that you could load an <strong>Activity</strong> after your application has been restarted and restore it’s state to the last time it was used.&#160; We’ll talk more about how to do this sort of longer term persistence later in the series.</p>
