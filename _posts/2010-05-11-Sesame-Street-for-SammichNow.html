BAM!! Problem solved.&#160; Plus, with the whole potential death aspect it automatically increases the cinematic value so there’s a chance that even adults will tune in to watch.&#160; Perhaps some of them will learn to read and count and shit…it’s never too late, right? </p>  <p><a onclick="return hs.expand(this)" class="highslide" href="http://sammichnow.com/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/SesameStreetforSammichNow_12E97/sn4_2.png"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="sn4" border="0" alt="sn4" src="http://sammichnow.com/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/SesameStreetforSammichNow_12E97/sn4_thumb.png" width="299" height="317" /></a> </p>  <p>Another example of a modernized plot line is in an upcoming episode where the importance of modernized MATHMATICS is the stressed lesson.&#160; Previous year’s attempts of showing examples/lessons of math would have the Count counting things and laughing about it in his creepy ass tone, or Cookie Monster wigging out counting the cookies he’s in full munch mode on.&#160; To provide this modernization in some sort of <i>kid friendly</i> content there’s an upcoming episode where Bert buys ten kilos of “sugar” from an overseas acquaintance of his in Afghanistan on Monday.&#160; When he goes to pull one out of the shoe boxes in the closet to cut it into grams (see, BAM, real math) on Wednesday he realizes he only has eight kilos left.&#160; He quickly realizes that his “roommate” Ernie must be stealing from him.&#160; He confronts Ernie about the new Camero SS parked in front of the apartment and the new (real) fur coat Ernie has been wearing lately – so, Ernie hits him in the leg with a lead pipe and takes off out the window.&#160; For two plus weeks Bert has been looking for Ernie to “talk” to him about the issue and he really wants to send Ernie a strong message for his actions.&#160; So Bert sought out some advice from his consigliore, The Count.&#160; The Count hooks him up with some zen-truth and tells him some shit like “Bert, two are stronger than one, ha ha ha, but three or more helps you get shit done son, uh-ha-ha-ha”.&#160; So Bert sets out to create a “network” of friends (in Spanish I think they’re called “cartels” – BAM!&#160; Bilingual lesson), he calls this group “The Jihad” and he will use this network to help him find Ernie and talk to him.&#160; After all, many hands make lighter work.&#160; Tune in to see how Bert’s adventure pans out!</p>  <p><a onclick="return hs.expand(this)" class="highslide" href="http://sammichnow.com/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/SesameStreetforSammichNow_12E97/sn5_2.jpg"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="sn5" border="0" alt="sn5" src="http://sammichnow.com/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/SesameStreetforSammichNow_12E97/sn5_thumb.jpg" width="295" height="245" /></a> </p>  <p>You’re eff’d Ernie, Bert is one motivated vengeful prick.</p>  <p>You get the idea by now I’m sure.</p>  <p>The point to all of this is…Sesame Street has sadly become a bit outdated.&#160; The show either needs to get it up to today’s <em>REAL</em> standards or just go away and stop teasing our youth with incomplete and biased “data”.&#160; Otherwise, we’re just wasting the little kids’ (aka disease carriers) time.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </p>  <p><a onclick="return hs.expand(this)" class="highslide" href="http://sammichnow.com/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/SesameStreetforSammichNow_12E97/sn6_2.png"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="sn6" border="0" alt="sn6" src="http://sammichnow.com/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/SesameStreetforSammichNow_12E97/sn6_thumb.png" width="567" height="391" /></a> </p>  <p>So, get with it “parents/donors”.&#160; It’s time to turn this around for the kids’ sake…the only other choice is for you (parents) to quit screwing without rubbers.&#160; Or perhaps both?&#160;&#160; </p>  <p>I call for YOUR support on this.&#160; If you’re against us we can and will send the real Bert to your house, but heads up, he’s a little strung out lately and easily agitated. </p>  <p><a onclick="return hs.expand(this)" class="highslide" href="http://sammichnow.com/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/SesameStreetforSammichNow_12E97/sn7_2.jpg"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="sn7" border="0" alt="sn7" src="http://sammichnow.com/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/SesameStreetforSammichNow_12E97/sn7_thumb.jpg" width="244" height="292" /></a> </p>  <p><i>You lookin at me Hip Hop?&#160; Want to start some static</i>?</p>
