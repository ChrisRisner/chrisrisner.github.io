<p><img style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; display: inline; float: right" title="CodeMash 2011" alt="CodeMash 2011" align="right" src="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/twitter2012badge.png" /></p>  <p>Recently, I finally got off my ass and volunteered to speak at a few sessions.&#160; By volunteered, I mean I submitted abstracts and was selected, so that’s pretty awesome.&#160; The two conferences I’m going to be speaking at will be <a title="CodeMash" href="http://www.codemash.org">CodeMash</a> and <a title="1DevDayDetroit" href="http://1devdaydetroit.com/">1DevDayDetroit</a>.&#160; </p>  <p>CodeMash is a relatively new conference that started in 2007.&#160; I actually attended the conference the first year they had it but haven’t been back since.&#160; Where most conferences deal with a “limited” selection of technology (i.e. Microsoft has conferences regarding Microsoft stuff, Google has Google ones, etc), CodeMash covers a wide variety of technologies from Java to .Net, PHP to Ruby, and more.&#160; Attending this conference really gives developers the chance to see what else is out there and how other people do things.&#160; This year, CodeMash opened registration on October 24th (at 10:24 AM mind you) and sold out after 20 minutes.&#160; Considering that this conference isn’t fronted by any huge technology company and isn’t what you think of when you think “Huge Product Release”, this is pretty incredible.&#160; I’ll be doing a presentation on the <a title="Intro to Android Development" href="http://www.codemash.org/Sessions#Intro+to+Android+Development">Introduction to Android Development</a>.&#160; This session is going to be meant for people that haven’t done mobile development before.&#160; It will cover the basics of Android development, the tools necessary, and how the Android Marketplace works.&#160; As I’ve been doing a good amount of Android development, I’m pretty excited to be giving this presentation at what’s quickly becoming a pretty big conference.&#160; CodeMash is going down in Sandusky, Ohio on January 11th – 13th.</p>  <p><img style="margin: 0px 5px 5px; display: inline; float: right" align="right" src="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/1DevDayDetroit2011.png" />The second conference, 1DevDayDetroit, is a smaller conference that is, obviously, in Detroit.&#160; This is a smaller and newer conference that focuses on getting the development community in Metro Detroit together to share and learn about different technology programs.&#160; At this conference I will be speaking on <a title="Cloud to Device Messaging" href="http://code.google.com/android/c2dm/">Cloud to Device Messaging (C2DM)</a> for Android.&#160; This is a bit more of an advanced Android topic and I’m really looking forward to it as it will be my first conference presentation.&#160; This conference is taking place at the Compuware building in Detroit on November 4th and 5th.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>If you’re attending either of these conferences, stop by for my presentation and let me know how it was.</p>
