<p><img style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; display: inline; float: right" align="right" src="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/200px-Apple-logo.png" width="170" height="208" />It’s been just about a week since I posted the last day in the <a title="31 Days of iOS" href="http://chrisrisner.com/31-Days-of-iOS">31 Days of iOS</a>.&#160; Much like when I finished the similar <a title="31 Days of Android" href="http://chrisrisner.com/31-Days-of-Android">31 Days of Android</a> series, I thought it would be a good idea to share some reflections I had on posting this series.&#160; Compared with the Android articles, I think I learned a lot more while writing the iOS ones as I had done less recent development for iOS when I started writing.&#160; That being said, this was a huge learning experience.</p>  <p><strong>Commit</strong></p>  <p>When I wrote the Android series I started posting articles when I had only prewritten about 10 posts.&#160; This meant that at the pace I was going, I had finished posting everything that I had already written by the time I got to day 12 or 13.&#160; So I was forced (by myself) to write and get out a new article every single day.&#160; This lead to a lot of late nights working on articles.&#160; I really wanted to avoid that this time around so I decided I wouldn’t start posting articles until I had finished at least around 25 of them.&#160; Since I was giving myself so much leeway, I didn’t start posting articles until about 3 and a half months after I started.&#160; That’s right, I started writing the series in September of 2012 and didn’t start posting until January 1st of 2013.&#160; So while I overdid it last time, I think I kind of underdid it this time around.&#160; I would say that there is a point in between what I did for these two series which would have been more appropriate.&#160; </p>  <p><strong>Plan ahead but be flexible</strong></p>  <p>Just like last time, I mapped out the articles I thought I would want to write ahead for each day in the series.&#160; As I proceeded with writing though, things quickly changed and I had to pull some days out or break other days up into multiple days.&#160; Some articles I fully replaced because they just didn’t make sense with the overall theme of the series.&#160; So if you’re going to start a big project like this, make a plan, but don’t be afraid to be a little bit flexible.</p>  <p><strong>Make sure you’re learning</strong></p>  <p>It’s great to write about stuff you know forwards and backwards so that other people can take advantage of the time and effort you’ve put in.&#160; However, I felt even more satisfaction having to learn quite a bit while I wrote this series.&#160; I guess the overall point here is that you shouldn’t be afraid to be ambitious and say “I’m going to write about X even though that means I need to learn about X.”&#160; This is a great way to commit yourself to learning something.&#160; Additionally, writing about it really makes you want to feel like you understand how something works (though I’m not saying I am a complete expert over all of the subjects I spoke about).</p>  <p><strong>In the end</strong></p>  <p>This was a great series to work on.&#160; I learned a lot from it and I’m already getting great feedback from people who are finding it useful.&#160; Two of my biggest goals with my writing are to learn and to help people.&#160; With a series like this, I’ve accomplished that in spades.</p>  <p><strong>Next up</strong></p>  <p>I’m going to go back to doing some more posts about using <a title="Windows Azure Mobile SErvices" href="http://www.windowsazure.com/mobile">Windows Azure Mobile Services</a> with iOS and Android first.&#160; Then I’m going to take a look at the articles I wrote in both the <a title="31 Days of iOS" href="http://chrisrisner.com/31-Days-of-iOS">iOS</a> and <a title="31 Days of Android" href="http://chrisrisner.com/31-Days-of-Android">Android</a> series and see where it makes sense to write updates for those posts.</p>
