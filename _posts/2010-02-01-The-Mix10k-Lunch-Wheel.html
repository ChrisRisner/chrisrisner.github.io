<p><a onclick="return hs.expand(this)" class="highslide" href="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/634006497567248418.gif"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 10px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="Mix10k" border="0" alt="Mix10k" align="right" src="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/634006497567248418.gif" width="244" height="243" /></a> The MIX conference is hosting (and has for at least the last year) a <em>little</em> competition called Mix10k.&#160; The goal is to make some sort of web application that only takes up 10 kilobytes of space.&#160; Now it’s pretty hard to impress upon someone what 10K really is.&#160; I’ll try to give you a few examples:</p>  <ul>   <li>Windows 7 Notepad is 189 K</li>    <li>Windows 7 Calculator is 897 K</li>    <li>A typical browser is between 500 and 1000 K</li>    <li>10,000 typed characters is 10 K</li>    <li>It’s not uncommon to see terabyte drives these days.&#160; A terabyte is about 1024 * 1024 * 100 * 10 K.</li> </ul>  <p>So suffice to say, 10 KB is not exactly a lot of space to write a program in.&#160; The challenge here is to do something that is at least decent without going over.&#160; It’s not easy to do.&#160; Most of the time by the time you’ve thrown even a simple image into an application, you’ve already gone over that limit.&#160; As I am <a title="Going to Mix" href="http://chrisrisner.com/I%E2%80%99m-going-to-Mix10!">going to MIX this year</a>, I felt participating in the challenge would be a great way to get revved up for the conference.&#160; The first challenge was figuring out what to create.&#160; A few years ago my friend Scott made a convenient way for us to figure out where to go to lunch, a Lunch Wheel.&#160; It was basically a windows app which you could use to spin a wheel with different eateries on it.&#160; The wheel would randomly spin and you would have your restaurant.&#160; It’s been a while since I saw this Lunch Wheel and didn’t really have any idea where it was, so it was definitely time for a new one.&#160; So, for my Mix10k application, I made a <a title="Silverlight LunchWheel" href="http://mix10k.visitmix.com/Entry/Details/242">Silverlight LunchWheel which you can see here</a>.&#160; There are obviously some (a lot) improvements that could be made, but I was working with limited space.&#160; Once the wheel was submitted and approved, I put a few different versions up on the site.&#160; A slightly improved (spacing and spelling issues) <a title="Improved Lunch Wheel" href="http://chrisrisner.com/home/viewcontent/lunchwheel">LunchWheel can be found here</a>.&#160; A very helpful <a title="Beer Wheel" href="http://chrisrisner.com/home/viewcontent/beerwheel">BeerWheel can be found here</a>.&#160; And lastly, a lovely <a title="Liquor Wheel" href="http://chrisrisner.com/home/viewcontent/liquorwheel">LiquorWheel can be found here</a>.&#160; Sooner or later I’ll post more information on how I made the LunchWheel as well as the source code so you can make your own!</p>
