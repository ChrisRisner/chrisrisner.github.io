Now, we could also put up the stats for what it’s like putting this on a sammich vs. actual bacon (in any possible situation real bacon should be used…if possible, use both bacon and Baconnaise) but you can just go <a href="http://www.jdfoods.net/products/nutrition/" target="_blank">here</a> to see it.&#160; So do yourself a favor and find a store that sells it or <a href="http://store.baconsalt.com" target="_blank">buy some online</a>.&#160; Up soon we’ll review another favorite of ours, BaconSalt.&#160; For now, get yourself some Baconnaise-or possibly better, get some <a href="http://store.baconsalt.com/Bacon-Lip-Balm_p_40.html" target="_blank">bacon lip balm</a> and lather your lips up.</p>
