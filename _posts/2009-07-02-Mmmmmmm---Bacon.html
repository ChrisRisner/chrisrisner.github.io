<p>In my continued effort to eat healthy and avoid the pitfalls of the common north American culinary experience (re: fast food) I’ve been doing my best to not get suckered into going to lunch with work folk as it inevitably leads to some brand of unhealthy eating.&#160; Sadly my will power is not always the best and yesterday I was convinced to go to Taco Bell. Upon arriving at the newly remodeled Toxic Hell, I was greeted by a particular brand of evil:&#160; the <a href="http://www.tacobell.com/baconcheesypotatoburrito/">Bacon Cheesy Potato Burrito</a>.&#160; It was as if someone had ratted out my penchant for bacon to the creative department of TBell and they threw together a ferocious feast just for me.&#160; Alas, I succeeded in avoiding this and stayed on the Fresco menu (yeah, it was SOOOO much more healthy, I know).&#160; Later in the day though, my friend PJ informed me that he had just had a Bacon Cheesy Potato Burrito and that it was essentially orgasmic.&#160; Perhaps I’ll get drunk enough to try one of these beauties before they are lost to the menu.</p>  <p><a onclick="return hs.expand(this)" class="highslide" href="http://chrisrisner.com/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/Mmmmmmm.Bacon_8FF2/image_2.png"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://chrisrisner.com/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/Mmmmmmm.Bacon_8FF2/image_thumb.png" width="404" height="302" /></a></p>
