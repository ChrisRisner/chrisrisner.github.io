<p><a onclick="return hs.expand(this)" class="highslide" href="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/634003144233522332.jpg"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="Veritas" border="0" alt="Veritas" align="right" src="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/634003144233522332.jpg" width="195" height="36" /></a> For some time now I’ve been writing the framework for this site with the intention of releasing it publicly.&#160; With the recent release of MVC2 and .Net 4.0 I figured that while rewriting the site, it would be a good time to also make it available.&#160; So hopefully, this will be part 1 in a series of how to create your own blog engine using MVC2 and .Net 4.0 and will be accompanied by the source code.&#160; As we go along, I’ll explain why I’m doing things the way I am.&#160; If you disagree, feel free to comment away.</p>  <p>To begin with, there are a few constraints we’re going to have.&#160; As this site is already live and using the “first version” of what we’re going to create, we need to make sure we don’t break any URLs in the process.&#160; One of the worst things about trying to solve a computer problem is googling the problem, finding what looks like a solution, clicking on the link and getting a 404.&#160; Secondly, many (or most) web hosts only allow you to run web applications in Medium trust.&#160; While not entirely necessary if the host is running Windows Server 2008 and has things configured correctly, this is usually done to protect the users sharing the same server.&#160; However, this protection comes with it’s own problems.&#160; Namely, restricted permissions in code.&#160; Lastly, like any other blog engine, we want to make something that you could hand off to your grandmother and she’d be able to use it.</p>  <p>Moving along, we need a name for what we’re working on.&#160; Instead of just referring to this as “the site” or “the blog engine” or something equally unidentifiable, we’ll give our project a code name, Veritas.&#160; Veritas is Latin for truth, which is kind of funny since a lot of what is written on the internet isn’t exactly that.&#160; So going forward, articles will be titled “Veritas: What this article is about – Part X”.&#160; </p>  <p>So how do we start and where do we go?&#160;&#160; I’m going to try to break things up into different articles so it’s a little bit easier to go from section to section.&#160; Tentatively, we’ll have the following articles:</p>  <ol>   <li>This summary and description of the project. </li>    <li>Designing the database support tables. </li>    <li>Designing the database entry tables.</li>    <li>Creating the basic project and solution structure. </li>    <li>Base objects we’ll use throughout the site. </li>    <li>Error logging. </li>    <li>Email handling. </li>    <li>The UI design. </li>    <li>Data Access with <a title="Entity Framework 4.0" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/data/aa937723.aspx" target="_blank">Entity Framework 4.0</a>. </li>    <li>Adding a <a title="MetaWeblogAPI" href="http://www.xmlrpc.com/metaWeblogApi" target="_blank">MetaWeblogAPI</a> accessor so we can use <a title="Windows Live Writer" href="http://windowslivewriter.spaces.live.com/" target="_blank">Live Writer</a>. </li>    <li>Enabling viewers to add comments. </li>    <li>Preventing spam in the comments. </li>    <li>Creating an RSS feed for entries and comments </li>    <li>Handling authentication and authorization. </li>    <li>Creating a file uploader. </li>    <li>Creating an Admin section. </li>    <li>Automatically adding <a title="HighSlide" href="http://highslide.com/" target="_blank">highslide</a> to pictures you post using Live Writer. </li> </ol>  <p>Now we’re waiting until pretty far into the series to get to creating an administration section.&#160; We’ll use the admin section for stuff like adding new categories, changing configuration options, and updating entries.&#160; So until then we’ll have to do some manual DB changes here and there.&#160; I’ll provide the SQL for those queries when necessary so you don’t get lost.&#160; </p>  <p>I’m sure some other topics will come up and the order of things might change.&#160; If there is a particular area I glaze over a little too quickly and you’d like more info on, let me know and I’ll get it up here.</p>  <p>At the end of all this, we’ll have rewritten the framework that is currently hosting this site and will have actually replaced it.&#160; Stay tuned for more coming soon.</p>
