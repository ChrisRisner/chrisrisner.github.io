<p><img style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; display: inline; float: right" title="Windows Azure" alt="Windows Azure" align="right" src="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/windowsazurevertical.jpg" width="300" height="129" />Hot on the heels of yesterday’s <a title="Windows Azure Mobile Services" href="http://chrisrisner.com/Announcing-Windows-Azure-Mobile-Services">Mobile Services release</a>, today my team released an update to the <a title="Windows Azure Training Kit" href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;id=8396">Windows Azure Training Kit</a>.&#160; The training kit includes a wealth of information on how to start using all the different areas of Windows Azure.&#160; Up until today, the training kit didn’t contain anything specific to iOS and Android development, but happily, that is no more.&#160; </p>  <p>The first thing added is a <a title="iOS and Android connectivity to Windows Azure Websites PPT Deck" href="https://github.com/WindowsAzure-TrainingKit/WATK-Presentations/tree/master/DevCamps-iOSAndroidAndWindowsAzure">PowerPoint deck</a> which goes over connecting iOS and Android clients to Windows Azure Websites.&#160; As you can tell if you’ve been reading this site, this is an area I’ve been focusing on lately.&#160; The second addition, was two demos:&#160; the <a title="The URL Shortener Demo" href="http://chrisrisner.com/Windows-Azure-Websites-and-Mobile-Clients--Wrap-Up">URL Shortener</a> and a GeoLocation sample.&#160; I’ve covered in detail how to set up and get the <a title="UrlShortener" href="http://chrisrisner.com/Windows-Azure-Websites-and-Mobile-Clients--Wrap-Up">URL Shortener</a> running on this site already and in the very near future, I’ll be doing the same thing with the GeoLocation sample.&#160; This should give you a better understanding of the advantages of connecting a mobile client to a backend in Windows Azure Websites, as well as how to create that backend (in PHP in these examples).&#160; As always, if you have feedback or questions, I’d love to hear about it.</p>
