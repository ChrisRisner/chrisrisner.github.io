<p><img style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; display: inline; float: right" title="Android Day 9" alt="Android Day 9" align="right" src="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/android-200.png" />Inevitably while working on an Android application, you’ll need to debug a problem.&#160; Today we’ll talk about how to handle those problems and debug your code.&#160; We’ll pick up where we left off yesterday in our <a title="31 Days of Android" href="http://chrisrisner.com/31-Days-of-Android">31 Days of Android series</a>.</p>  <p>The first part of debugging we will cover is using breakpoints in your application.&#160; There are a few different ways to place a breakpoint in your application.&#160; First, select the line of code you’d like to put a break in and either:&#160; hit <strong>Ctrl+Shift+B</strong>, or go to <strong>Run—&gt;Toggle Breakpoint</strong>, or double click in the blue column to the left of the line in the Eclipse code editor.&#160; In order to get the code to stop executing at your breakpoints, you need to debug your app instead of running it.&#160; To do so, click <strong>F11</strong> or right click your project and go to <strong>Debug As—&gt;Android Application</strong>.&#160; Now your application will pause whenever it reaches a breakpoint.&#160; Once this happens you can highlight variables to see what their values are or you can use the <strong>Variables</strong> and <strong>Expressions</strong> tabs in Eclipse.</p>  <p>When your breakpoint is reached for the first time, Eclipse will pop up a window confirming that you want to switch <strong>Perspectives </strong>to the Debug perspective.&#160; When this happens, say yes and you’ll be taken to a window which shows the callback stack, console, code view, and a tab (in the top right) with <strong>variables</strong>.&#160; <strong>Variables </strong>will show you the values of all available variables and allow you to expand complex types to see their values. In addition, if you go to <strong>Window—&gt;Show View—&gt;Expressions</strong> you’ll launch the expressions window.&#160; Expressions will allow you to enter variable statements as well as assign values to variables on the fly.&#160; Both of these windows are very useful for figuring out what is happening in your code.</p>  <p>Next we’ll talk about a very useful logging tool, <strong>Logcat</strong>.&#160; In Eclipse, go to <strong>Window—&gt;Show View—&gt;Other</strong> and look for <strong>Logcat.&#160; </strong>This will launch the Logcat window in the bottom of Eclipse:</p>  <p><img title="Logcat" alt="Logcat" src="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/android_day_eight_logcat.png" /></p>  <p>On the right you’ll see all the messages logged by the emulator we’re currently running or the currently connected device.&#160; On the left we can set up filters so that we only see certain messages.&#160; It’s great that we can see the messages, but let’s talk about how to actually log them:</p>  <div class="csharpcode">   <pre class="alt">Log.i(<span class="str">&quot;DaySevenActivity&quot;</span>, <span class="str">&quot;This is an info message&quot;</span>);</pre>

  <pre>Log.e(<span class="str">&quot;DaySevenActivity&quot;</span>, <span class="str">&quot;This is an error message&quot;</span>);</pre>
</div>
<style type="text/css">



.csharpcode, .csharpcode pre
{
	font-size: small;
	color: black;
	font-family: consolas, "Courier New", courier, monospace;
	background-color: #ffffff;
	/*white-space: pre;*/
}
.csharpcode pre { margin: 0em; }
.csharpcode .rem { color: #008000; }
.csharpcode .kwrd { color: #0000ff; }
.csharpcode .str { color: #006080; }
.csharpcode .op { color: #0000c0; }
.csharpcode .preproc { color: #cc6633; }
.csharpcode .asp { background-color: #ffff00; }
.csharpcode .html { color: #800000; }
.csharpcode .attr { color: #ff0000; }
.csharpcode .alt 
{
	background-color: #f4f4f4;
	width: 100%;
	margin: 0em;
}
.csharpcode .lnum { color: #606060; }</style>

<p>Here we’re logging an Info message and then an Error message.&#160; These will then show up in Logcat as a green and red message, respectively.&#160; This is a great way to quickly and easily get incite into what’s happening in your app and what code is being reached.&#160; Just a warning, you’ll want to set up a filter because the emulator will log a lot of messages that don’t have to do with your app and an actual device will log many more. </p>

<p><img style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; display: inline; float: right" align="right" src="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/android_day_eight_ddms.png" />The last piece on debugging we’ll go over today is <strong>DDMS</strong>.&#160; In Eclipse go to <strong>Window—&gt;Open Perspective—&gt;Other</strong>.&#160; Chose <strong>DDMS </strong>and open it.&#160; This will open the <strong>DDMS </strong>perspective and in the future, you can switch back and forth between the <strong>Java</strong>, <strong>Debug</strong>, and <strong>DDMS</strong> perspectives in the top right of Eclipse.&#160; DDMS enables you to switch between the emulators you are running and the devices you have connected, trigger incoming phone calls, view Logcat, and more.&#160; In the top left, you can switch between emulators and devices as well as take screenshots of apps running on both the emulators and devices.&#160; </p>

<p>With all of these toosl at your disposal, you should now be capable and prepared to debug your Android applications.&#160; </p>
