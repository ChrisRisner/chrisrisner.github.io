<strong>Update</strong>: I was not originally checking to make sure there were any child views before getting the TextView.  This has been fixed thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/stroughtonsmith" title="stroughtonsmith">@stroughtonsmith</a>.<br /><br />

I was recently working on an Android sample where I wanted to display a toast in the app.&#160; By default, a toast will appear at the bottom of the screen with no special formatting consideration given to the text (i.e. it’s aligned to the left side).&#160; This wasn’t really the experience I wanted the user to have.&#160; What I wanted was for the text to be centered in the toast.&#160; Then I decided I wanted the toast centered on the screen.&#160; Thankfully these are all easy tasks to accomplish.&#160; </p>  <p><strong>The normal toast</strong></p>  <p>Creating a toast is a very easy thing to accomplish.&#160; Here’s the code I can use to show a toast from an Android Activity:</p>  <p><script src="https://gist.github.com/ChrisRisner/7306976.js?file=normalToast.java"></script></p>  <p>The first parameter is the context (i.e. the Activity), then followed by the text to display.&#160; Lastly we have the length of time to display the toast (which we’re using the <strong>Toast.LENGTH_SHORT</strong> constant for).&#160; Finally we call <strong>show()</strong> on the returned Toast object.&#160; This results in a toast which looks like this:</p>  <p align="center"><img title="Normal Toast" alt="Normal Toast" src="https://crcomcstorage.blob.core.windows.net/images/android_normal_toast.jpg" width="185" height="319" /></p>  <p>If there was a little less text, this might look fine as it would almost appear centered.&#160; Unfortunately, unless we know the exact size of our toast text all the time, it’s pretty likely we’ll run into a situation (like this one) where it doesn’t look good.</p>  <p><strong>Centering the text</strong></p>  <p>Centering the text is pretty simple and requires us to pull out the <strong>TextView</strong> that is actually being used to display the text and then set it’s gravity like this:</p>  <p><script src="https://gist.github.com/ChrisRisner/7306976.js?file=toastCenterText.java"></script></p>  <p>Notice that we have to first pull out a LinearLayout because that is the view inside our Toast.&#160; Next we can get the TextView as the first child of the LinearLayout.&#160; Then we can call <strong>setGravity</strong> on our TextView.&#160; When we do this, our toast looks like this:</p>  <p align="center"><img title="toast center text" alt="toast center text" src="https://crcomcstorage.blob.core.windows.net/images/android_toast_center_text.jpg" width="185" height="319" /></p>  <p><strong>Centering the toast in the screen</strong></p>  <p>Centering our toast in the screen is actually much easier than centering the text.&#160; In fact we can do it with just one additional line of code (after we separate out the toast creation and showing):</p>  <p><script src="https://gist.github.com/ChrisRisner/7306976.js?file=toastCenterToast.java"></script></p>  <p>We’ve just added a call to <strong>setGravity</strong> for our Toast (where as before we were setting the gravity on our TextView).&#160; Now when we display the toast it will look like this:</p>  <p align="center"><img title="Toast center screen" alt="Toast center screen" src="https://crcomcstorage.blob.core.windows.net/images/android_toast_center_screen.jpg" width="185" height="319" /></p>  <p><strong>Putting it all together: centering the toast and text</strong></p>  <p>If you want to center the text in the toast and the toast in the screen, you just need to put the last two things together:</p>  <p><script src="https://gist.github.com/ChrisRisner/7306976.js?file=toastCenterAll.java"></script></p>  <p>We’ve just taken the “center text” example and dropped in the new line from the “center toast” example.&#160; Now when we show our toast, it looks like this:</p>  <p align="center"><img title="Centering a toast and it&#39;s text" alt="Centering a toast and it&#39;s text" src="https://crcomcstorage.blob.core.windows.net/images/android_toast_center_all.jpg" width="185" height="319" /></p>  <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>  <p>Today we looked at how easy it is to adjust the position of a toast in Android as well as how to adjust the alignment of the text inside of that toast.&#160; Using what we’ve demonstrated today, you should be able to figure out how to place your toasts wherever you might want to and in any alignment you need.</p>
