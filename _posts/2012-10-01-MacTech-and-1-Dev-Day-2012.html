<p><img style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; display: inline; float: right" title="MacTech" alt="MacTech" align="right" src="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/MacTechLogo2.jpg" />Over the next two months, I am going to be presenting at a couple different conferences.&#160; At both of these conferences I’ll be presenting on connecting mobile clients to <a title="Windows Azure" href="https://www.windowsazure.com">Windows Azure</a>.&#160; </p>  <p><strong><a title="MacTech" href="http://www.mactech.com/conference/about"><font size="3">MacTech</font></a></strong></p>  <p>MacTech is a 3 day conference in mid-October for Apple developers and IT Pros.&#160; The conference is split into two different tracks: development and IT.&#160; This conference is organized and ran by (you guessed it) the group that does <a title="MacTech Magazine" href="http://www.mactech.com/">MacTech magazine</a>.&#160; On the development side talks will cover developing for OS X and iOS.&#160; IT talks go over how to support your company when you have Apple devices deployed.&#160; I haven’t been to MacTech before but judging by the <a title="Tweets from MacTech 2011" href="http://www.mactech.com/conference/tweets">buzz around the conference last year</a>, it should be a lot of fun.&#160; I’ll be speaking about connecting iOS and <a title="Windows Azure Mobile Services" href="https://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/mobile/">Windows Azure Mobile Services</a>.&#160; Mobile Services presents a great way to build iOS apps which allows developers to focus on what’s important:&#160; the client.&#160; In moments a developer can get a backend up and running which gives them access to data storage, server side scripting, user authentication, and push notifications.&#160; This is a really exciting technology and I’m pretty happy I’ll be able to start talking about it with iOS and OS X developers.&#160; </p>  <p><a title="1DevDayDetroit" href="http://1devdaydetroit.com/"><img style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; display: inline; float: right" align="right" src="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/devdaysdetroit.jpg" />1DevDay Detroit</a></p>  <p>Having just left Michigan, I hoped I’d be back soon. Thankfully I’m returning to attend the 1DevDay Detroit conference on November 17th.&#160; The Dev Days conferences are designed to help educate the software engineering community in and around Detroit, Michigan.&#160; This will actually be my second year of speaking at the 1DevDay conference.&#160; <a title="OneDevDay Detroit 2011" href="http://chrisrisner.com/Speaking-at-CodeMash-and-OneDevDay-Detroit">Last year I spoke</a> on Android’s Cloud to Device Messaging framework.&#160; This year I’ll be speaking on developing Android and iOS clients with <a title="Windows Azure Mobile Services" href="https://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/mobile/">Windows Azure Mobile Services</a>.&#160; If you haven’t picked up on theme yet, it’s that Windows Azure Mobile Services are totally amazing and you should check them out if you haven’t already.&#160; </p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>If you’re going to be attending either of these conferences, be sure to stop by and say hi.&#160; Also, if you have any questions about Windows Azure, the Cloud, or mobile apps, let me know.</p>
