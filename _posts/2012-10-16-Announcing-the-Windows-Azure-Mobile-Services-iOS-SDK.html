<p><img style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; display: inline; float: right" align="right" src="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/mobile-service-logo-3.png" />About a month and a half ago, we <a title="August release of Windows Azure Mobile Services" href="http://chrisrisner.com/Announcing-Windows-Azure-Mobile-Services">released Windows Azure Mobile Services to the world</a>.&#160; Today I’m happy to announce the initial release of our iOS SDK for <a title="Windows Azure Mobile Services Dev Center" href="https://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/mobile/">Windows Azure Mobile Services</a>.&#160; This is not an officially “done” SDK but is still actively in development.&#160; In addition to the iOS SDK supporting the majority of the features the Win8 SDK does, some new features made it in this release as well.&#160; In this article, I’ll walk you through a high level overview of the features of the iOS SDK as well as some of the new things that have come out.&#160; I’ll be posting deeper dives for relevant topics in the coming days.</p>  <p><strong>Windows Azure accounts</strong></p>  <p>In order to play around with Mobile Services and the iOS SDK, you’ll need a Windows Azure account.&#160; You can <a title="Free Windows Azure Account" href="http://aka.ms/MobileServices-iOS-SDK">sign up for a free account here</a>.&#160; When you sign up you’ll get a 3 month trial of some of the other features of Windows Azure, however, Mobile Services is a separate feature which is currently free during the preview period.</p>  <p><strong>The SDK</strong></p>  <p>You have a couple of different options for getting the iOS SDK.&#160; Just like the Windows 8 managed client SDK, the <a title="Windows Azure Mobile Services SDKs on GitHub" href="https://github.com/WindowsAzure/azure-mobile-services">iOS SDK has been open sourced to GitHub</a>.&#160; This means that not only do you have access to the source code, but you can fork it and contribute to it by making pull requests.&#160; Additionally, now when you go to the quickstart page after creating a new mobile service, you’ll have links to download the iOS SDK in addition to a Xcode starter project that already has the SDK connected:</p>  <p align="center"><img title="iOS options in Mobile Services Quickstart" alt="iOS options in Mobile Services Quickstart" src="https://crcomcstorage.blob.core.windows.net/images/zumo-ios-release-get-started.jpg" width="414" height="530" /></p>  <p><strong>Data storage</strong></p>  <p>In the iOS SDK, you get the same data storage access as you do in the Win8 SDKs.&#160; Under the covers, the SDK works by sending JSON over the wire to Mobile Services’ REST API.&#160; If you’re using the SDK though, you don’t need to worry about that.&#160; If you pull down the pre-created quick start project from the <a title="Windows Azure portal" href="http://manage.windowsazure.com">Windows Azure portal</a>, you’ll have a service class that wraps the functionality for accessing data storage.&#160; This class is instantiated with a table name.&#160; With that done you can add and update items by passing a NSDictionary which contains each item in the table to the service class.&#160; Deleting items is done by sending a NSDictionary over that just contains the item id.&#160; Lastly, there are filtering methods which make use of the NSPredicate class to facilitate querying your table.</p>  <p><strong>Authentication</strong></p>  <p>When the Win8 SDK was launched, the only form of authentication that was supported were Windows Live accounts.&#160; With the release of the iOS SDK, we’re also supporting Facebook, Twitter, and Google authentication.&#160; In order to “turn these on” you need to go to the <a title="Windows Azure Portal" href="http://manage.windowsazure.com">Windows Azure</a> portal and enter the Identity settings for whichever app you want to authenticate to.&#160; Prior to doing any of these, you’ll need to sign up at the correct site by creating a new application.&#160; You can find links to where you sign up for these here:</p>  <ul>   <li><a title="Facebook Developers Portal" href="http://developers.facebook.com">Facebook</a> </li>    <li><a title="Google APIs signup" href="https://code.google.com/apis/console">Google</a> </li>    <li><a title="Twitter Developer Portal" href="http://dev.twitter.com">Twitter</a> </li> </ul>  <p>Once you’ve set the identity settings in your app, you can then authenticate using methods in the <strong>MSClient</strong> class in the SDK.&#160; You can <a title="iOS Authentication with Windows Azure Mobile Services" href="http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/mobile/tutorials/get-started-with-users-ios/">read more about setting up and authenticating from an iOS app here</a>.</p>  <p><strong>Push Notifications</strong></p>  <p>For this drop of the iOS SDK, push notifications aren’t supported.&#160; These are coming and will be here before you know it.&#160; Once they are, I’ll be announcing it.</p>  <p><strong>Service Scripts</strong></p>  <p>As with any other app you connect to Mobile Services, you get the same powerful service scripting triggers that are fired on any CRUD interaction with your data tables.&#160; There is quite a lot you can do in these scripts (join to other tables, perform HTTP requests to other services, and more).&#160; As of today, service scripts have access to the Azure SDK which means they can access blob storage, table storage, and more.&#160; Also, the ability to send emails through SendGrid and SMS text messages through Twilio are now supported as well.</p>  <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>  <p>If you’re doing iOS development, you have to take a look at <a title="Windows Azure Mobile Services" href="https://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/mobile/">Windows Azure Mobile Services</a>.&#160; You can get your backend up and running in seconds and get some very powerful capabilities.&#160; Mobile Services will help allow you to focus on creating the best mobile app you can, without worrying too much about how you’ll handle data storage or authentication.&#160; Plus, we’ll be adding more features to Mobile Services very frequently in the future.&#160; Stay tuned for info on all of these features and more.</p>
