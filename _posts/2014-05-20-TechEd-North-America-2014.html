<p><img style="float: right; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; display: inline" src="https://crcomcstorage.blob.core.windows.net/images/TechEd_2014.png" width="145" align="right" height="63" />Last week I flew out to Houston, Texas to attend this year’s <a title="TechEd North America" href="http://northamerica.msteched.com/">TechEd North America</a> conference.&#160; TechEd is the big Microsoft conference for IT Professionals and Enterprise Developers.&#160; The big difference between this conference and the <a title="Build 2014" href="http://chrisrisner.com/Build-2014-Recap">Build conference</a> we just had is the technology focus.&#160; While TechEd really does have an Enterprise focus, Build is centered around development (whether it’s Enterprise or Commercial or what have you).&#160; At this year’s conference I delivered two sessions.</p>  <p><strong>Java on Azure</strong></p>  <p>This session explained the different ways you can host or run Java on Azure.&#160; Together with <a title="Brian Benz" href="http://brianbenz.com/">Brian Benz</a>, we went over the following topics:</p>  <ul>   <li>Running Java on VMs (Oracle, Linux, Windows Server) </li>    <li>Running Java on Platform-as-a-Service (Cloud Services and Web Sites) </li>    <li>Accessing Azure Software-as-a-Service features with Java (tons of stuff) </li> </ul>  <p>This session wasn’t super coding deep but was really mostly an overview.&#160; There isn’t a ton of focus on Java at TechEd (shocking I know) so instead of trying to go deep into one specific area, we tried to give everyone a general idea of their options for Azure and Java.&#160; You can check out the video for the session here:</p>  <p><iframe style="height: 360px; width: 640px" src="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd/NorthAmerica/2014/DEV-B384/player?h=360&amp;w=640&amp;format=html5" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>  <p><strong>High-Volume, Low Latency Mobile Push Notifications</strong></p>  <p>The second session I did covered how to use Azure Notification Hubs to do push notifications down to Mobile apps.&#160; This session included some really cool topics like:</p>  <ul>   <li>Registering with Hubs and pushing notifications </li>    <li>Registering with Tags and pushing to specific tags </li>    <li>Tag expressions </li>    <li>Geo-based push </li>    <li>Template based registration </li>    <li>Server vs Client registration </li> </ul>  <p>I really enjoyed this session because I was able to demonstrate Notification Hubs working with iOS, Android, and Windows Store apps all at once!&#160; There was a lot of code used and walked through as part of this session so I posted it all, along with a brief walkthrough on setting it up, on <a title="Push Notifications Session Code" href="https://github.com/ChrisRisner/TechEdNA2014Code">GitHub</a>.&#160; You can check out the video for this session here:</p>  <p><iframe style="height: 360px; width: 640px" src="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd/NorthAmerica/2014/DEV-B345/player?h=360&amp;w=640&amp;format=html5" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>  <p>If you have any questions or feedback about either of the sessions, please let me know.</p>
