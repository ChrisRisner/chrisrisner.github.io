<p>Two days ago it was beyond humid.&#160; As is only typical on days like that, it ended with storms.&#160; &quot;Horrible Storms.&quot;&#160; By that I mean the tv informed me that there were tornado watches in the Jackson area but all we really got here was almost heavy rain and wind for about 40 minutes.&#160; However, as per typical for this area, the power went out before the rain had even started.&#160; Unlike <a href="http://atomicinternet.homeip.net/">the Lloyd</a>, I don't have a generator so instead of enjoying a fan or something along those lines, I sat in my garage and drank a couple beers while watching the rain and charging my phone (despite knowing storms were on the way, I let my phone get close to death and after the power went out the only options were plugging into the car or the laptop) while longing for a cigar.&#160; I didn't go to DTE's site to report the outage immediately (under the assumption that someone else would), but by the time I did about 3 hours after the power went out (and a good amount of time after the storm had passed) they still had no estimated time for repairs.&#160; Upset but whatever, I went to sleep sans fan, AC, or night light.&#160; After waking up in the morning, I checked DTE's site again to find they still had no estimate.&#160; 12 hours after the power went out, still not even an estimate.&#160; Later in the day at work at around 12 PM (time not exactly sure but close enough) they finally had an estimate in of 11 PM that night until 2 am the following day.&#160; I wasn't pleased, but whatever, I'd have power that night.&#160; Not more than an hour later, I checked again and WTF, power is fixed.&#160; Good work DTE.&#160; </p>
