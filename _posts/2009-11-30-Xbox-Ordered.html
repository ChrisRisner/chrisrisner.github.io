<p><a onclick="return hs.expand(this)" class="highslide" href="http://chrisrisner.com/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/XboxOrdered_14D4D/image_6.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="XBox 360" border="0" alt="XBox 360" align="right" src="http://chrisrisner.com/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/XboxOrdered_14D4D/image_thumb_2.png" width="226" height="171" /></a> Today I unnecessarily ordered an Xbox 360.&#160; Not just any Xbox 360 though, the 360 Modern Warfare 2 Limited Edition one.&#160; As part of a Cyber Monday deal, for the same price as it had regularly been available ($399.99) it also came with Assassin's Creed 2, Dragon Age: Origins, as well as 3 free months of Xbox Gold membership.&#160; All together, it’s about a $550 value.&#160; If I finish these games quickly and pull an <a href="http://atomicinternet.homeip.net" target="_blank">Atomic</a> and sell the games, I can get my $399 xbox for just over $300.&#160; Was the order unnecessary?&#160; Absolutely.&#160; Do I regret buying it?&#160; Not until it’s time to pay the bills.&#160; Do I look forward to the day I pwn <a href="http://atomicinternet.homeip.net/news.asp?startat=article&amp;article=1033" target="_blank">Atomic at achievement points</a>?&#160;&#160; Paramount.&#160; At the moment the game orders are showing up as processing and the Xbox is showing up as Delayed (lame).&#160; When will my Xbox arrive?&#160; Who knows.</p>
