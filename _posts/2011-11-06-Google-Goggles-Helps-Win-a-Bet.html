<p><img style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; display: inline; float: right" title="Billie Holiday" alt="Billie Holiday" align="right" src="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/billieholiday.jpg" />Last weekend I was attending a Halloween party and we were discussing the wall art at our friends’ house.&#160; Outside of their kitchen they had some framed prints of the early jazz era.&#160; Knowing that I’m not very knowledgeable about this part of history, my fiancé bet me that I couldn’t figure out who one of the pictures was of.&#160; The picture, which is fairly infamous, was of a woman in profile as she was singing.&#160; Erin didn’t say I couldn’t use my phone, so, having never used the program before but knowing of it, I loaded up <a title="Google Goggles" href="http://www.google.com/mobile/goggles/">Google Goggles</a>.&#160; In less than 5 seconds, Goggles had pulled up images searches as well as music album results for <a title="Billie Holiday" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billie_Holiday">Billie Holiday</a>.&#160; It was particularly incredible because all of the people standing around us were amazed that such a program even existed.&#160; This goes to show you that many people aren’t even aware of how advanced technology has gotten and how easy it is to find answers and get information.&#160; Image the augmented reality capabilities of such technology.&#160; Imagine if you were wearing contacts that were able to pull this information from what you were seeing on the fly and show it to you without anyone knowing.&#160; Imaging if you were in school taking a test and your contacts were silently delivering the answers (ok maybe this isn’t a good application).&#160; At any rate, thanks for helping me win a bet Goggles!</p>
