<p>For the third year in a row, I’d like to take a look back at the last year and reflect on a few of the things that happened as well as go over some stats from my site:</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p><strong>Highlights of 2014</strong></p>  <p>It really seems hard to top 2012, but 2014 had some pretty great moments:</p>  <ul>   <li><strong>January </strong>Nothing exciting.</li>    <li><strong>February </strong>Did some travel for work (Atlanta) and trained for a 12k (I’d fallen out of running so this was hard).</li>    <li><strong>March </strong>Visited numerous places in Europe (Amsterdam, Paris, Epernay, Versailles, Bruges) and ran the Hot Chocolate 12k.</li>    <li><strong>April </strong>Spoke at Build in San Francisco as well as helped with the keynote.&#160; Oh yeah, and I was ON STAGE for part of the keynote.&#160; Also had my second anniversary at Microsoft.&#160; Also sold our old boat and bought a new (to us) boat.</li>    <li><strong>May </strong>Did a lot of travel for work (Orlando, Houston, Boston) and a bit for fun (Whidbey Island)</li>    <li><strong>June </strong>Had some friends visit.</li>    <li><strong>July </strong>Took a cruise to Alaska.&#160; Very scenic trip though I think it turned me off from cruise ships.</li>    <li><strong>August </strong>More work travel (Columbus, Wisconsin Dells, Denver)</li>    <li><strong>September </strong>Turned 31, went to Arizona for a wedding.</li>    <li><strong>October </strong>Nothing exciting.</li>    <li><strong>November </strong>Helped with the keynote at the NYC Connect event (where we announced the cross-platform build engine for Visual Studio Online), Boston, and San Francisco for work. </li>    <li><strong>December </strong>Took a few days to go to Hawaii for Xmas.&#160; It rained heavily.</li> </ul>  <p><strong>Top 3 Blog Posts</strong></p>  <p>By looking at unique view count, these were the top three blog posts in 2014:</p>  <ul>   <li><a href="http://chrisrisner.com/31-Days-of-Android--Day-23%E2%80%93Writing-and-Reading-Files">31 Days of Android: Day 23 – Writing and Reading Files</a></li>    <li><a href="http://chrisrisner.com/31-Days-of-iOS--Day-4%E2%80%93Working-with-Multiple-View-Controllers-and-Storyboards">31 Days of iOS: Day 4 – Working with Multiple View Controllers and Storyboards</a></li>    <li><a href="http://chrisrisner.com/31-Days-of-iOS--Day-5-Programmatically-showing-View-Controllers">31 Days of iOS: Day 5 – Programmatically Showing View Controllers</a></li> </ul>  <p>Not a single one of those was actually from 2014.&#160; </p>  <p><strong>Top Azure Post</strong></p>  <p>The top Azure related post was <a href="http://chrisrisner.com/Authentication-with-Windows-Azure-Mobile-Services">Authentication with Azure Mobile Services</a>.&#160; One of the focuses of this article was how to do custom authentication with Mobile Services which continues to be a popular topic.&#160; </p>  <p><strong>The Visitors</strong></p>  <p>Here are the stats on the people that visited the site:</p>  <ul>   <li><strong>Unique Visitors</strong>:&#160; This time around there were 222k unique visitors on the site.&#160; That’s nearly 100k more than last year.&#160; </li>    <li><strong>Visits</strong>:&#160; 328k visits.&#160; That’s over 130k more than last year.</li>    <li><strong>Page Views</strong>: 601k page views.&#160; Nearly 190k more than last year.</li>    <li><strong>Location and Language</strong>:&#160; The US led with 23% of the visits, followed by Indian (18.62%) and then the UK (4.43%).&#160; English was again the language of choice.&#160; </li>    <li><strong>Browser and OS</strong>:&#160; Chrome led with 56.61%, then Safari at 21.18%, Firefox at 15.54%, and IE at 4.41%.&#160; Compared with last year, Chrome was up, Safari was up, Firefox was down, and IE was down.&#160; For OS, OS X was at 47.85%, Windows at 41.62%, iOS at 4.23%, Linux at 3.59%, and Android at 2.4%.&#160; This was a decrease for Windows, an increase for OS X, decrease for iOS, decrease for Linux, and increase for Android.&#160; Windows Phone was at 0.14% and Chrome OS at 0.03%.</li>    <li><strong>Mobile</strong>:&#160; Mobile traffic was at 4.59% for mobile and 2.64% for tablet for a total of 7.23% which was just about the same as last year.&#160; iPad led with 29.51%, then iPhone at 28.52%, then “not set” at 12.22%, then Nexus 5(2.14%), Nexus 7 (1.81%), and the Galaxy S3 (1.22%).&#160; </li>    <li><strong>Where you came from</strong>:&#160; Overwhelmingly people came from search (86.6%), then Direct (9.7%), then searches.</li> </ul>  <p>This was a big increase over last year despite not really adding that much content.&#160; There were only 23 new entries with a decent percentage of them being mostly puff (non-technical content or recaps of conferences).</p>  <p><strong>Fitibit Stats</strong></p>  <p>For sake of being able to hopefully compare last year against this year, I’m going to include some stats from the wrap up email I received from Fitbit.</p>  <ul>   <li><strong>Total Distance</strong>:&#160; 1847 miles</li>    <li><strong>Total Steps Taken</strong>:&#160; 3,934,007</li>    <li><strong>Most Active Month: </strong>July</li>    <li><strong>Most Active Day</strong>:&#160; January 25th</li>    <li><strong>Least Active Day</strong>: December 27th</li>    <li><strong>Weight Difference</strong>:&#160; I’d rather not say…</li> </ul>  <p><strong>What’s ahead in 2015</strong></p>  <p>I’ve got a number of things planned for the next year:</p>  <ul>   <li>Get back to blogging a bit more with at least 50 posts here as well as at least 10 posts on my other blog about <a href="http://sailingmakai.com">sailing</a>.</li>    <li>Release an actual app or game into a marketplace (Google Play, iOS App Store, Win App Store, etc).</li>    <li>Double the miles I went last year (so 3694).</li>    <li>Do some more travel (hoping for a fall trip to the UK).</li> </ul>  <p>I’ll report back in 2016 and let you know how it went.</p>
