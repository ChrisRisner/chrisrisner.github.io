<p>With many other people taking a moment to reflect over the past year, I thought it might be a good time for me to do so as well.&#160; This article is very much going to take the format of <a title="Phil Haack&#39;s Reflections on 2012" href="http://haacked.com/archive/2013/01/01/reflections-on-2012.aspx">Phil Haack’s Reflections on 2012</a><em><strong> </strong></em>post.&#160; First, we’ll start with some highlights over the last year.&#160; </p>  <p><strong>Highlights of 2012</strong></p>  <p>It was an extremely exciting year so I’ve got a ton of things to be happy about.</p>  <ul>   <li><strong>January </strong>I spoke at my first major conference, <a title="CodeMash 2012" href="http://chrisrisner.com/CodeMash-2012">CodeMash</a>.&#160; I actually attended the first CodeMash many years ago and the conference has grown by leaps and bounds since then.&#160; I actually just went back last week to attend CodeMash 2013 and delivered two sessions. </li>    <li><strong>February</strong> A little company named Microsoft reached out to me about a pretty interesting position.&#160; If you know me or follow the blog, you already know how this turned out. </li>    <li><strong>March</strong> I got <a title="I got married" href="http://chrisrisner.com/Married">married</a>.&#160; This was obviously pretty exciting for me.&#160; We were married in Hawaii and had an amazingly great time. </li>    <li><strong>April</strong> Remember where I said Microsoft reached out to me in February, well in <a title="Starting work at Microsoft" href="http://chrisrisner.com/Returning-from-Whence-I-Came!">April I started working for them</a>.&#160; I was working remote since we still had a lot going on in Michigan but it was only a matter of time before we made the big move across the country.&#160; </li>    <li><strong>May</strong> Since we got married in Hawaii, we needed to throw a party back in Michigan for all of the family and friends that couldn’t join us on the island.&#160; This was a blast for just about everyone that came, even the party crashers from Europe! </li>    <li><strong>June</strong> I went on my first work trip which was for a Day of Azure in London.&#160; It was pretty exciting and I learned a lot about presenting on this trip. </li>    <li><strong>July</strong> As we were nearly ready to move, Erin and I wrapped up a lot of visits with friends including trips to western and northern Michigan as well as Chicago. </li>    <li><strong>August</strong> We finally made the <a title="Moving from Michigan to Washington" href="http://chrisrisner.com/So-Long-Michigan%E2%80%A6Hello-Washington">big move from Michigan out to Washington</a>.&#160; We’re still loving Washington and are really happy we moved (despite missing all of our friends). </li>    <li><strong>September</strong> Technically August (but the end of it) but we launched <a title="Windows Azure Mobile Services" href="http://www.windowsazure.com/mobile">Windows Azure Mobile Services</a> which is what I’m primarily focusing on for work. </li>    <li><strong>October </strong>I spoke at <a title="MacTech" href="http://chrisrisner.com/MacTech-and-1-Dev-Day-2012">MacTech</a> in LA.&#160; This was my first experience speaking at a primarily Apple focused event and it went over really well.&#160; My favorite quote was <a title="Awesome quote from MacTech" href="https://twitter.com/chainq/status/258706884851277825">“I’d never thought the first tech which makes me think ‘hey, this is really cool’ on a Mac conference is from Microsoft.”</a>&#160; Just think about how crazy that is.&#160; </li>    <li><strong>November</strong> I spoke at <a title="Build 2012 Conference" href="http://chrisrisner.com/Build-2012&ndash;Mobile-Solutions-with-Windows-Azure">Build</a> and <a title="1DevDay Detroit 2012" href="http://chrisrisner.com/1DevDay-2012">1DevDay Detroit</a>.&#160; Build was a huge achievement as I was very new at Microsoft and this was there biggest developer event of the year.&#160; We also went to Hawaii….again.&#160; What can I say, the food was good and flights to Hawaii are super cheap from Washington (compared with flying from Michigan). </li>    <li><strong>December</strong> We started December in Hawaii.&#160; It was a mini-repeat of our wedding trip, minus the actual wedding.&#160; Kauai is definitely one of our favorite places in the world (ok we have a lot of places we still need to visit).&#160; More important, technically, was that we <a title="iOS support for Mobile Services" href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2012/12/04/ios-support-with-windows-azure-mobile-services-now-with-push-notifications.aspx">officially launched iOS support for Windows Azure Mobile Services</a>. </li> </ul>  <p>2012 was huge for me, both personally and professionally.&#160; I couldn’t be happier with where I’m at with my job and where Erin and I are at in our relationship and lives.</p>  <p><strong>Top 3 blog posts</strong></p>  <p>Just by looking at the unique view count, these are the top three blog posts I had in 2012:</p>  <ul>   <li><a title="31 Days of Android" href="http://chrisrisner.com/31-Days-of-Android">31 Days of Android</a> - This was the summary article for my big Android series in 2012.&#160; It contains links to each article in the series. </li>    <li><a title="Writing and Reading Files with Android" href="http://chrisrisner.com/31-Days-of-Android--Day-23%E2%80%93Writing-and-Reading-Files">Writing and Reading Files with Android</a> - This article from the Android series focused on reading and writing files. </li>    <li><a title="Multiple activities and intents with Android" href="http://chrisrisner.com/31-Days-of-Android--Day-5%E2%80%93Adding-Multiple-Activities-and-using-Intents">Using Multiple Activities and Intents with Android</a> - Another article from the Android series.&#160; So it was a bit popular.&#160; This one focused on using multiple activities in your application. </li> </ul>  <p><strong>Top 3 non-Android series posts</strong></p>  <p>So the big ones were all part of my Android series.&#160; However, I few articles about other things:</p>  <ul>   <li><a title="Windows Azure Mobile Services and IOS" href="http://chrisrisner.com/windows-azure-mobile-services-and-ios">Windows Azure Mobile Services and iOS</a> - This article announced the initial “in-development” SDK for iOS and Mobile Services.&#160; Since then we’ve made a lot of improvements and moved it out of “in-development” and into officially supported. </li>    <li><a title="Accessing Outlook Contacts via Exchange Web Services" href="http://chrisrisner.com/Programmatically-Accessing-Outlook-Contacts-Via-Exchange-Web-Services">Accessing Outlook Contacts via Exchange Web Services</a> - This article (a pretty old one) deals with pulling a user’s contacts out of Exchange using Exchange Web Services.&#160; Crazy that it’s still so popular. </li>    <li><a title="iOS and Windows Azure communication with Signal-R" href="http://chrisrisner.com/iOS-and-Windows-Azure-Communication-using-SignalR">iOS and Windows Azure communication using Signal-R</a> - Signal-R is a super cool way of doing two way communication (re: sending information from the server to the client).&#160; Signal-R is becoming a bigger and bigger thing so there should be a lot more exciting developments for this over the next year. </li> </ul>  <p><strong>The visitors</strong></p>  <p>Let’s look at some stats on the people that actually visited the site:</p>  <ul>   <li><strong>Unique Visitors</strong> There were 47,251 unique visitors for the year.&#160; </li>    <li><strong>Visits</strong> There were 68,801 visits to the site. </li>    <li><strong>Page View</strong> There were 144,112 page views meaning on average, people visited 2.09 pages on each visit. </li>    <li><strong>Location and Language </strong>The vast majority of people were from the United States (at 16,304) followed by India (12,999) and then the UK (3,820).&#160; Overwhelmingly the language of choice was English. </li>    <li><strong>Browser and OS</strong> Almost half the traffic (48.02%) was from Chrome, then Firefox (27.71%), Internet Explorer (11.89%) and finally Safari (6.79%).&#160; Windows was at the head of the OSes (with 70.95%), then OS X (14.91%), and then Linux (7.99%). </li>    <li><strong>Mobile</strong> About 5% of the traffic was considered “mobile” with the iPad leading the iPhone, leading the Galaxy Nexus.<strong>&#160;</strong> </li>    <li><strong>Where you came from</strong> Overwhelmingly people got here from Google (49,043), then directly (10,876), and then Twitter (1,861). </li> </ul>  <p>What’s really nice is that outside of a few peaks, traffic has been overwhelmingly growing over the year.&#160; At the beginning of the year I was averaging in the low 100s for per day visits.&#160; At the end of the year, that moved to the high 200s and low 300s.</p>  <p>It will be fun to see how things grow over the next year and see what posts are leading by 2014.&#160; Thanks for all your visits and feedback!&#160; I truly appreciate the comments and feedback and hope this continues to be a place which can help developers learn.</p>
