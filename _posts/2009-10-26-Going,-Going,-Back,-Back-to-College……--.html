<p>This past weekend was my alma matter’s homecoming and a group of us made the trek across the state to see <a href="http://www.wmubroncos.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=24299&amp;SPID=1922&amp;ATCLID=204820171&amp;DB_OEM_ID=4600">WMU defeat the Bulls of Buffalo 34-31 in OT</a>.&#160; While in Kalamazoo I noticed a few things.</p>  <p>1. College (assuming you “go away”)&#160; years are the best years of your entire life.&#160; Some will say getting married or having a kid, I disagree (although I have neither).&#160; You feel as if you are busy and overwhelmed, but you are not.&#160; You feel as if it is too much and too hard, but it isn’t even close and the amount of free time that you have is <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=recockulous">recockulous</a> compared to what you will see for the rest of your life (see above comment about marriage and kids).&#160; Think about it MIP’s, eating frozen goldfish (I did not do this, I video taped), road rally’s, fights at the bar, house parties, girls, IM sports, dirty ass houses, kegs in the basement, dorm room parties, the <a href="http://www.phisigmakappa.org/">Phi Sig</a> house (I was not a paying member, just a guy that should up to party), </p>  <p><a onclick="return hs.expand(this)" class="highslide" href="http://sammichnow.com/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/GoingGoingBackBacktoCollege_1245B/Football_2.jpg"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; margin-left: 0px; border-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="Football" border="0" alt="Football" align="left" src="http://sammichnow.com/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/GoingGoingBackBacktoCollege_1245B/Football_thumb.jpg" width="164" height="244" /></a>2. The people that you meet in college will most likely be around for a hell of a long time.&#160; I look at the people that I met before college and I keep in touch with a handful, two of them are probably my closet friends to date (on of them was a college roommate for two years, before he decided my antics were too much).&#160; The rest of the peeps I keep in touch with are from college.</p>  <p>3. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUsT__k9dAU">Jesse Jaymes</a> was dead nuts on.&#160; It is literally like shooting fish in a barrel, I digress.</p>  <p>4. College’s have amazing food.&#160; I am not talking about Red Robin or BW3, I am talking about places that are in college towns and nowhere else.&#160; The restaurant for me is <a href="http://www.bilbospizza.com/">Bilbo's Pizza.</a>&#160; “Back when we were kids” there was a Bilbo’s on campus where we would skip class for beer and garlic cheese bread with dill sauce, the shit was (and still is) amazing.</p>
