<p><img style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; display: inline" src="http://storage.chrisrisner.com/images/microsoft-band.jpg" width="393" align="right" height="220" />Late Wednesday night, <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/10/29/7118533/microsoft-health-band-hub-for-fitness-data">news broke</a> about Microsoft’s soon to be released fitness wearable dubbed: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-band/en-us">Microsoft Band</a>.&#160; When the news broke, it was shortly followed by links to the <a title="Microsoft Band" href="http://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-band/en-us">official page</a> for the Band as well as news that it would be available for purchase in Microsoft stores and online on Thursday, as in the very next day.&#160; While there are always <a title="Rumors on Microsoft Band" href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/7/2/5865895/microsoft-fitness-band-smartwatch-rumors">rumors</a> about what products tech companies are researching or building, I don’t recall seeing anything substantial in regards to Microsoft building or releasing a fitness wearable.&#160; There certainly weren’t screenshots of the actual device and I didn’t hear about anyone <a title="iPhone Prototype left in Bar" href="http://gizmodo.com/5520164/this-is-apples-next-iphone">leaving a test unit sitting on a bar somewhere</a>.&#160; For all intents and purposes, this product was launched without being leaked.&#160; This is made even more impressive when you think about what was actually built:</p>  <ul>   <li>The band itself which involved hardware and software being constructed for the device</li>    <li>An iOS app</li>    <li>An Android app</li>    <li>A Windows Phone app</li> </ul>  <p>That’s a lot of moving pieces and people for something to fly under the radar and not end up on <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/microsoft/">All About Microsoft</a>.&#160; Let’s look at a few other arguably amazing facts:</p>  <ul>   <li>The Microsoft Band has met with overwhelmingly positive reviews: <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/10/29/7118533/microsoft-health-band-hub-for-fitness-data">theVerge</a>, <a href="http://gizmodo.com/microsoft-band-hands-on-an-activity-tracker-thats-actu-1652836668">Gizmodo</a>&#160; </li>    <li>The Microsoft Band beat the Apple Watch to market</li>    <li>The Microsoft Band works with all three of the most popular mobile operating systems</li>    <ul>     <li>It’s true that Cortana functionality only works if you’re paired with WinPhone</li>   </ul>    <li>The Microsoft Band has been out in public being worn by beta testers for months!</li>    <ul>     <li>Check out a <a title="Damien Edwards&#39; tweet" href="https://twitter.com/DamianEdwards/status/527857674319167488">few</a> <a title="DSplaisted&#39;s tweet" href="https://twitter.com/dsplaisted/status/527876012403474432">tweets</a> from people at Microsoft</li>   </ul>    <li>The Microsoft Band SOLD OUT at numerous Microsoft Stores</li> </ul>  <p>No matter how you slice it, this adds up to something pretty cool.&#160; It’s even nicer to see that this came from Microsoft as the company continues to pursue it’s mobile first, cloud first mandate.&#160; I haven’t purchased a Band yet (they were sold out before I left work) but I hope to pick one up soon!</p>
