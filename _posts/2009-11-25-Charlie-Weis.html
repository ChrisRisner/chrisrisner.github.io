<p>I have done my best to stay quiet regarding Charlie Weis and my beloved Irish.&#160; I will give you my opinion up front and then explain why.&#160; Charlie Weis should STAY at the University of Notre Dame.&#160; I know, your surprised.&#160; Pick up your jaw and listen.</p>  <p>Before I start, I am picking the Irish to go to Stanford and win this weekend.&#160; Watch out Palo Alto, here come the Irish.&#160; It is time to wake up the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnPxOttpVdI&amp;NR=1">echoes</a>.&#160; </p>  <p>Reason 1: Good at recruiting.&#160; The belt has brought in great classes with freshman contributing each and every year.&#160; Something we haven’t had in a long time.&#160; With that said, we have to get them to perform well enough to NOT go 6-6.</p>  <p>Reason 2: Charlie is a GREAT face of the program.&#160; Clean, gives back to the community, runs a charity for his daughter.&#160; All pointing at Charlie being a great person and mentor for the kids he is coaching.</p>  <p>Reason 3: Rebuilding is not an option.&#160; If Charlie leaves so will <a href="http://www.journalgazette.net/article/20091106/BLOGS02/911059945">Clausen</a> and <a href="http://www.nfldraftscout.com/ratings/dsprofile.php?pyid=72032&amp;draftyear=2011&amp;genpos=WR">Tate</a>, leaving us with <a href="http://www.uhnd.com/articles/football/dayne-crist-season-5568/">Dane Crist</a> to play QB (who by the way has a torn ACL right now that was suffered in the WSU game) and we are losing 34 players off the roster to graduation.</p>  <p>Reason 4: Who is going to replace Charlie?&#160; <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601079&amp;sid=a8OqJGxJeovc">Urban Meyer</a>?&#160; Chuckie?&#160; Brian Kelly?&#160; <a href="http://www.rep-am.com/articles/2009/11/24/sports/college/doc4b0bdb441808d565662442.txt">Candidates</a></p>  <p>Reason 5: This is one I will take some shit for, and that is ok.&#160; I have come to terms with my athletics obsession for a university where only the top percentile of academic and athletic individuals are allowed in.&#160; Notre Dame is NOT a football factory.&#160; We are not Florida, Texas, USC, Alabama, etc.&#160; “We are ND” and need to remember that.&#160; Our team is built of the highest percentage of graduating athletes (football and school wide).&#160; It is quite the idea that we can’t accept fast thugs and hooligans and are still able to compete at the level we do.</p>  <p>Reason 6: If Weis stays…*gulp* we have the opportunity to compete for the national championship NEXT year.&#160; Call me a slappy that is fine.&#160; If Weis stays so does Clausen and Tate.&#160; Along with Rudolph and Floyd.&#160; Those are four players that are at the top of their position.&#160; The defense can’t get much worse, so if it gets a little better and look back at this year we beat SC, Navy, UConn and probably even Pitt.&#160; At least 3 of those 4.</p>  <p>I would like to see the offseason go like this.</p>  <p>1. Keep Weis</p>  <p>2. Assuming Weis is fired, turn down a bowl game and immediately start looking for a coach.&#160; Coaches we want in order (yes I do realize this is a wish list):</p>  <blockquote>   <p>1. Urban Meyer</p>    <p>2. Bob Stoops</p>    <p>3. Butch Davis</p>    <p>4. Jim Harbaugh</p>    <p>5. Brian Kelly/Pat Fitzgerald</p> </blockquote>  <p>3. Top 5 recruiting class.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>1. This is going to be tough if Weis is fired.&#160; Kids will scatter because they were coming here for Weis, you just have to hope that you get a top 3 coach from above and he brings his blue chips with him.&#160; Especially Stoops and Meyer.</p> </blockquote>  <p>4. Clausen and Tate stay at ND for one more year.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>1. This should probably be number two, since it is obvious that this hinges on Weis.</p></blockquote>
