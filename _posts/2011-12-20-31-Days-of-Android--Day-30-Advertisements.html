<p><img style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; display: inline; float: right" align="right" src="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/android_logo_money.png" />We’re getting quite close to the end of the <a title="31 Days of Android" href="http://chrisrisner.com/31-Days-of-Android">31 Days of Android</a> so it’s time to talk about how to make some money with your apps.&#160; There are several ways to make money with your applications.&#160; You could just charge for the sale of your app.&#160; Many developers do this and put out a free version with limited features to get users interested in paying for the full version.&#160; Another way to make money is through in-app purchases.&#160; This seems to be more common in games where you can charge users to get special perks or abilities for their in-game character.&#160; Another way to make money, and the focus of today’s article, is in-app advertisements.&#160; One quick note is that you NEED your project to target Android 3.2 or later.&#160; While previous projects targeted 2.2, the sample code today targets 4.0.&#160; You can <a title="Android Day Thirty Inital Source Code" href="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/DayThirtyInitial-2.zip">download the starter code we’ll use today here</a>.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p><strong>Creating an AdMob Account</strong></p>  <p>For today’s talk we’re going to use <a title="AdMob" href="http://www.admob.com/">AdMob</a>.&#160; AdMob is an advertising network owned by Google.&#160; There is no requirement to use AdMob in Android and there are other alternatives that you could implement yourself.&#160; Step one is to go to <a href="http://www.admob.com">www.admob.com</a> and sign up for an account.&#160; If you’re making an account for yourself, you’ll need to put your social security number in (remember the idea is that they’re going to pay you money so they need your info).&#160; If you’re entering it for a business, you’ll have to enter some information specific to your business (i.e. a Tax Identification Number).&#160; After that you can choose to have money put into a bank account or directly into your PayPal account.&#160; Once that is done you have to add a new site / app.&#160; Here you can choose between an <strong>Android App</strong>, <strong>iPad App</strong>, <strong>iPhone App</strong>, <strong>Smartphone Web</strong>, or a <strong>Windows Phone 7 App</strong> (this supports more than just Android).&#160; Choose <strong>Android App</strong> and then you’ll need to enter your app’s name and package.&#160; Once you’ve created your app, you should be taken to a page that lists your <strong>Publisher ID</strong> as well as give you a link to the <strong>Publisher Code</strong>.&#160; Download the code and keep track of the <strong>Publisher ID</strong> as you’ll need it later.&#160; </p>  <p><strong>Adding the AddMob Library to your Project</strong></p>  <p>Typically with any third party libraries, I will drop them into a <strong>Libs</strong> folder in my project’s directory prior to adding it to the project.&#160; After you do that, right click on your project in Eclipse and go to <strong>Properties</strong>.&#160; Choose the <strong>Java Build Path</strong> section from the left of the window and then the <strong>Libraries </strong>tab from the top of the window.&#160; Choose <strong>Add JARs</strong>, expand <strong>DayThirty/libs</strong> and choose <strong>GoogleAdMobAdsSDK-#.#.#.jar</strong>.&#160; When your done the properties window should look like this:</p>  <p><img style="display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" title="properties with AdMob library" alt="properties with AdMob library" src="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/android_daythirty_adding_library.png" /></p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p><strong>Manifest File Changes</strong></p>  <p>There are a few different manifest file changes you need to make.&#160; First you need to add permissions for <strong>INTERNET</strong> and <strong>ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE</strong>:</p>  <div class="csharpcode">   <pre class="alt">&lt;uses-permission android:name=<span class="str">&quot;android.permission.INTERNET&quot;</span>/&gt;</pre>

  <pre>&lt;uses-permission android:name=<span class="str">&quot;android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE&quot;</span>/&gt;</pre>
</div>
<style type="text/css">


.csharpcode, .csharpcode pre
{
	font-size: small;
	color: black;
	font-family: consolas, "Courier New", courier, monospace;
	background-color: #ffffff;
	/*white-space: pre;*/
}
.csharpcode pre { margin: 0em; }
.csharpcode .rem { color: #008000; }
.csharpcode .kwrd { color: #0000ff; }
.csharpcode .str { color: #006080; }
.csharpcode .op { color: #0000c0; }
.csharpcode .preproc { color: #cc6633; }
.csharpcode .asp { background-color: #ffff00; }
.csharpcode .html { color: #800000; }
.csharpcode .attr { color: #ff0000; }
.csharpcode .alt 
{
	background-color: #f4f4f4;
	width: 100%;
	margin: 0em;
}
.csharpcode .lnum { color: #606060; }</style>

<p>These are necessary because you’re displaying ads that the device has to fetch from the internet.&#160; Second, you need to add a new <strong>Activity</strong> into the xml with the other activities:</p>

<div class="csharpcode">
  <pre class="alt">&lt;activity android:name=<span class="str">&quot;com.google.ads.AdActivity&quot;</span></pre>

  <pre>android:configChanges=<span class="str">&quot;keyboard|keyboardHidden|orientation|screenLayout|uiMode|screenSize|smallestScreenSize&quot;</span>/&gt;</pre>
</div>
<style type="text/css">


.csharpcode, .csharpcode pre
{
	font-size: small;
	color: black;
	font-family: consolas, "Courier New", courier, monospace;
	background-color: #ffffff;
	/*white-space: pre;*/
}
.csharpcode pre { margin: 0em; }
.csharpcode .rem { color: #008000; }
.csharpcode .kwrd { color: #0000ff; }
.csharpcode .str { color: #006080; }
.csharpcode .op { color: #0000c0; }
.csharpcode .preproc { color: #cc6633; }
.csharpcode .asp { background-color: #ffff00; }
.csharpcode .html { color: #800000; }
.csharpcode .attr { color: #ff0000; }
.csharpcode .alt 
{
	background-color: #f4f4f4;
	width: 100%;
	margin: 0em;
}
.csharpcode .lnum { color: #606060; }</style>

<p>If you try to run your application without putting this in your manifest, your ad will actually say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You must have AdActivity declared in AndroidManifest.xml with configChanges.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p><strong>Adding the Publisher ID</strong></p>

<p>You don’t have to have your <strong>Publisher ID </strong>in your strings resource file but’s not a bad idea to put it there.&#160; Open your <strong>res/values/strings.xml</strong> and add “<strong>admob_id</strong>” in with the <strong>Publisher ID</strong> you got from the AdMob website:</p>

<div class="csharpcode">
  <pre class="alt"><span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">string</span> <span class="attr">name</span><span class="kwrd">=&quot;admob_id&quot;</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>a14eef56ac6acfb <span class="kwrd">&lt;/</span><span class="html">string</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span></pre>
</div>

<p><style type="text/css">


.csharpcode, .csharpcode pre
{
	font-size: small;
	color: black;
	font-family: consolas, "Courier New", courier, monospace;
	background-color: #ffffff;
	/*white-space: pre;*/
}
.csharpcode pre { margin: 0em; }
.csharpcode .rem { color: #008000; }
.csharpcode .kwrd { color: #0000ff; }
.csharpcode .str { color: #006080; }
.csharpcode .op { color: #0000c0; }
.csharpcode .preproc { color: #cc6633; }
.csharpcode .asp { background-color: #ffff00; }
.csharpcode .html { color: #800000; }
.csharpcode .attr { color: #ff0000; }
.csharpcode .alt 
{
	background-color: #f4f4f4;
	width: 100%;
	margin: 0em;
}
.csharpcode .lnum { color: #606060; }</style></p>

<p><strong>Adding an Ad to your Layout</strong></p>

<p>Now you can open your <strong>res/layout/main.xml </strong>layout to add an AD in.&#160; Go ahead and drop a <strong>com.google.ads.AdView</strong> element in above the <strong>TextView</strong> at the top:</p>

<div class="csharpcode">
  <pre class="alt"><span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">com.google.ads.AdView</span></pre>

  <pre>xmlns:googleads=&quot;http://schemas.android.com/apk/lib/com.google.ads&quot;</pre>

  <pre class="alt">android:id=&quot;@+id/ad&quot;</pre>

  <pre>android:layout_width=&quot;fill_parent&quot;</pre>

  <pre class="alt">android:layout_height=&quot;wrap_content&quot;</pre>

  <pre>googleads:adSize=&quot;BANNER&quot;</pre>

  <pre class="alt">googleads:adUnitId=&quot;@string/admob_id&quot; <span class="kwrd">/&gt;</span></pre>
</div>
<style type="text/css">


.csharpcode, .csharpcode pre
{
	font-size: small;
	color: black;
	font-family: consolas, "Courier New", courier, monospace;
	background-color: #ffffff;
	/*white-space: pre;*/
}
.csharpcode pre { margin: 0em; }
.csharpcode .rem { color: #008000; }
.csharpcode .kwrd { color: #0000ff; }
.csharpcode .str { color: #006080; }
.csharpcode .op { color: #0000c0; }
.csharpcode .preproc { color: #cc6633; }
.csharpcode .asp { background-color: #ffff00; }
.csharpcode .html { color: #800000; }
.csharpcode .attr { color: #ff0000; }
.csharpcode .alt 
{
	background-color: #f4f4f4;
	width: 100%;
	margin: 0em;
}
.csharpcode .lnum { color: #606060; }</style>

<p>Here you’re using the <strong>admob_id</strong> you put in your strings file just a moment ago.&#160; The last step you need to take is to load an <strong>AdRequest</strong> into your <strong>AdView</strong>.</p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p><strong>Loading the AdView with Ads and Using Test Mode</strong></p>

<p>Open the <strong>src/com.daythirty/DayThirtyActivity.java</strong> class and go to the bottom of the <strong>onCreate</strong> method.&#160; You need to do two things here:&#160; load the ads and add your device and emulator to test mode.&#160; While in development, it’s important that you add your devices and emulator to test mode so that you aren’t affecting your impressions inappropriately.&#160; Thankfully this is done very easy.&#160; For each device you just need to get it’s serial number which can be pulled from <strong>DDMS </strong>or from the device selection screen when running your app.&#160; When you’re done, your code should look like this:</p>

<div class="csharpcode">
  <pre class="alt">AdRequest request = <span class="kwrd">new</span> AdRequest();</pre>

  <pre>&#160;</pre>

  <pre class="alt">request.addTestDevice(AdRequest.TEST_EMULATOR);</pre>

  <pre>request.addTestDevice(<span class="str">&quot;015ED03511005018&quot;</span>);</pre>

  <pre class="alt">&#160;</pre>

  <pre>AdView ad = (AdView) findViewById(R.id.ad);</pre>

  <pre class="alt">ad.loadAd(request);</pre>
</div>
<style type="text/css">


.csharpcode, .csharpcode pre
{
	font-size: small;
	color: black;
	font-family: consolas, "Courier New", courier, monospace;
	background-color: #ffffff;
	/*white-space: pre;*/
}
.csharpcode pre { margin: 0em; }
.csharpcode .rem { color: #008000; }
.csharpcode .kwrd { color: #0000ff; }
.csharpcode .str { color: #006080; }
.csharpcode .op { color: #0000c0; }
.csharpcode .preproc { color: #cc6633; }
.csharpcode .asp { background-color: #ffff00; }
.csharpcode .html { color: #800000; }
.csharpcode .attr { color: #ff0000; }
.csharpcode .alt 
{
	background-color: #f4f4f4;
	width: 100%;
	margin: 0em;
}
.csharpcode .lnum { color: #606060; }</style>

<p>Here I’ve added my device’s serial number as a test device as well as the emulator.&#160; Then the same request is used to load the ads into your <strong>AdView</strong>.&#160; Now when you run your app, you should see an ad at the top (it may take a couple minutes to show up when you run for the first time):</p>

<p><img style="display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" title="Android with Ads" alt="Android with Ads" src="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/android_day_thirty_first_ads.png" width="433" height="341" /></p>

<p>Note that when your app first loads the Ad won’t be loaded yet and the <strong>TextView</strong> will be all the way at the top of the screen.&#160; Once the Ad loads, the rest of your UI elements will be pushed down.&#160; It’s worth keeping this in mind when you decide on the placement of your Ads.</p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p><strong>Different AD Sizes</strong></p>

<p>In the AD you’ve put into your project, you’ve set the size to be <strong>BANNER</strong>.&#160; This Ad size is 320 x 50.&#160; In portrait mode, the Ad should stretch across the screen.&#160; However, if you rotate to landscape, the Ad will be centered and only take up part of the screen:</p>

<p><img style="display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" title="Landscape Banner Ads" alt="Landscape Banner Ads" src="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/android_day_thirty_ads_landscape.png" width="499" height="215" /></p>

<p>There are other Ad sizes which are banner specific.&#160; <strong>IAB_MRECT</strong> is a medium rectangle and is sized at 300 x 250.&#160; <strong>IAB_BANNER </strong>is a full size banner and is 468 x 60.&#160; <strong>IAB_LEADERBOARD</strong> is 728 x 90.</p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p><strong>Passing Targeted Information to Ads</strong></p>

<p>As you might imagine, there is a lot of information that could be used to deliver more targeted Ads to your users.&#160; This is done using several methods on the <strong>AdRequest </strong>object.&#160; This is a list of the current methods:</p>

<ul>
  <li>setBirthday - Set the user's birthday. </li>

  <li>setGender - Specifies if the user is male or female. </li>

  <li>setLocation - Specify the user's current location </li>

  <li>setKeywords - Pass in keywords for specific ads (like &quot;Technology&quot;) </li>

  <li>setExtras - I'm not really sure. </li>

  <li>setPlusOneOptOut - Has something to do with plus oneing things. </li>
</ul>

<p>As noted, I’m not exactly sure what the last two methods are used for but the rest of these methods should enable you to present some pretty targeted Ads to your users.&#160; Do think about user privacy before you try to implement any of these.&#160; Some users are ok with this sort of information being passed around and others are very not ok with it.</p>

<p>Using what you’ve learned today, you should be able to put Ads in your applications and put them in the right place so they will look good.&#160; You can <a title="Android Day Thirty Final Source Code" href="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/DayThirtyFinal.zip">download the final code from today here</a>.</p>
