They provide a link to a <a title="Equal Heights Javascript" href="http://www.dynamicdrive.com/style/blog/entry/css-equal-columns-height-script/">javascript file that makes your columns have equal heights</a>.&#160; So on page load, all of the columns were made to have the same height.&#160; However, the problem still existed when I toggled the display on my comment div.&#160; What I needed to do was recall the functionality in the equal heights JavaScript.&#160; Pulling that into a callable function was easy enough (<a title="Equal Columns JS" href="http://chrisrisner.com/scripts/equalcolumns.js">and can be found here</a>).&#160; What you can also see there is a near duplicate method that, when called, does a reset on the setHeights method.&#160; I could have just added a parameter to the FixColumns method but as I was testing it out, I didn’t, and clearly I was too lazy to go back and do it right (I’ll have to fix that in the future).&#160; So now, if I call the FixColumns2 method after I show or hide the comments, it should all be fixed right?&#160;&#160; Well, if the comments div is fully expanded when FixColumns2 is called, then yes.&#160; However, since I got rid of the animation above, I wanted to make the comments div appear a little more elegantly.&#160; So instead of just calling the toggle method on my div, I switched up to calling slideToggle.&#160; Now my comments div gracefully expands instead of just impaling itself onto the page.&#160; However, now that the div isn’t at full height right away, if we call FixColumns2 and reprocess the column heights right away, we’ll only have the height of the div as far as it’s expanded.&#160; So instead of just calling FixColumns2 right away, we need to delay the start.&#160; Thankfully the functionality is already provided with the setTimeout method.&#160; So now, we call setTimeout('FixColumns2()', 1000); and one second later, the heights are reprocessed and the page looks correct again.&#160; In the future, I’d like to change this into a pure CSS way of handling it so that I’m not stuck with JavaScript.</p>  <p>Lastly, I added a custom google search box to the right side of the page.&#160; Now you can happily search through all the delicious content of the site.&#160; Have fun!</p>
