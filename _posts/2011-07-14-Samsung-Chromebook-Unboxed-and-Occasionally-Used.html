<p><img style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; display: inline; float: right" align="right" src="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/GoogleChrome.png" />As an attendee of <a title="GoogleIO 2011" href="http://chrisrisner.com/I%27m-Going-to-Google-IO%E2%80%A6and-you%27re-probably-Not">GoogleIO 2011</a>, I waited patiently for June 15th when Google was going to start selling their first two (non-prototype) <a title="Chomebook" href="http://www.google.com/chromebook/">Chromebooks</a>.&#160; Why was I waiting patiently?&#160; Because at the conference, they said that they were giving away a free chromebook to all of the attendees.&#160; Alas, June 15th rolled around and I didn’t have a Chromebook sitting in my mailbox.&#160; Thankfully Google did email everyone shortly after the 15th with instructions and a coupon code for ordering the <a title="Samsung Series 5 3G Chromebook" href="http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-3G-Chromebook-Arctic-White/dp/B004Z6NWAU/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1310608335&amp;sr=8-2">Samsung Series 5 3G Chomebook (in Arctic White)</a> along with a coupon for free 2 day shipping.&#160; Like a giddy schoolboy, I eagerly awaited the arrival of my new toy.</p>  <p>Two days later, I came home to a <a title="Laptop Sized Package" href="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-GjHVREYbKok/TgveEIWWmFI/AAAAAAAAArY/uSXFSn98Zlk/s640/2011-06-28_20-16-32_612.jpg">laptop sized package</a>.&#160; Inside said package was another box!&#160; And <a title="Inside of the Inside of hte Box" href="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-3EzkT3gCt78/Tgvd9_w1zgI/AAAAAAAAArM/6-TjhO0M-9Q/s640/2011-06-28_20-24-29_523.jpg">inside of that box</a> was a Chromebook, a delicious power adapter, some fire starters (manuals), and a VGA dongle.&#160; After pulling the Chromebook from it’s protective foam, I got my first look.&#160; The arctic white wouldn’t be my first choice in colors but it <a title="It looks ok" href="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-b7FeH1KgPvQ/Tgvd7C_UmhI/AAAAAAAAArI/r9qvRC0ZhBg/s640/2011-06-28_20-26-18_188.jpg">looks ok</a>.&#160; The cover has been tagged with both Samsung and Chrome (with the Chrome icon).&#160; After looking through the packaging, it was finally <a title="Time to Boot Up" href="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-wKPt6vibEUE/TgveB2aeLvI/AAAAAAAAArU/CF7dVLATiAo/s640/2011-06-28_20-21-15_438.jpg">time to boot up</a>.</p>  <p><strong><img style="margin: 3px 5px 5px 0px; display: inline; float: left" align="left" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-wKPt6vibEUE/TgveB2aeLvI/AAAAAAAAArU/CF7dVLATiAo/s288/2011-06-28_20-21-15_438.jpg" />So what is a Chromebook?</strong></p>  <p>Well if you haven’t watched the <a title="funny chromebook commercial" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVqe8ieqz10">pretty humorous Chromebook commercial</a>, it’s very similar to a Netbook.&#160; A netbook is a smaller (compared to most laptops but not the Macbook Air) laptop that’s primarily used for web browsing.&#160; The primary difference between a Chromebook and a Netbook though is that the Chromebook is JUST a BROWSER.&#160; It’s like turning on a computer and only having Internet Explorer or Firefox or Chrome or Safari.&#160; There is no windows or mac boot up, no Microsoft Office, no notepad, no wordpad, no calculator.&#160; All you get is the Chrome browser.&#160; If you’ve used Chrome on your windows box or your macbook, you’ve pretty much used the ChromeOS system.&#160; There are a few additions for handling things like wireless connections and logging in (with your gmail account) but other than that it’s the browser.</p>  <p><strong>What does “Just a Browser” mean?</strong></p>  <p>With it just being a browser, there aren’t a lot of services to start up or connections to make every time you turn the computer on.&#160; That means that you go from a turned off computer to hitting the web in less than 10 seconds.&#160; Since you’re using the web, your documents and pictures and settings aren’t just on the computer.&#160; They’re <em>safely </em>in the cloud.&#160; If you throw your Chromebook in the river (I’m pretty sure they tell you to in the <a title="Throw it in a river" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVqe8ieqz10">commercial</a>) you can get a new one and not lose anything.&#160; What about installing updates and new applications?&#160;&#160; Updating the operating system is done for you automatically.&#160; New applications are just web sites.&#160; Anything you can get to on the web somewhere else, you can get to on your Chromebook.&#160; As far as security goes, nothing is foolproof.&#160; That being said, it looks like <a title="Security of Chromebook" href="http://www.google.com/chromebook/features-security.html">security was of paramount concern</a> when they designed the Chromebook and it looks like through the combination of both hardware and software security, you’ve got a pretty safe system (provided no one breaks into all of Google’s servers).</p>  <p><strong>What’s it like to use?</strong></p>  <p>Again, it’s just like using a browser.&#160; Except that’s all you get.&#160; If you’re content with just browsing and doing the things you can do in the web (which are more considerable than most people know) it works great.&#160; One issue I ran into though was when I wanted to use a calculator.&#160; I asked a few people today what they would do if I asked them to pull up a calculator on their computer.&#160; No one says “oh I go to math.com” or “I just put 1+1 into google and it tells me the answer.”&#160; Without exception (I only asked a handful of people to be fair) they all said they opened the operating system’s calculator.&#160; With ChromeOS there isn’t (as far as I’m aware) a built in calculator.&#160; You do need to go to math.com (or another website) or just put it in Google search.&#160; Other than this, I didn’t really run into issues with basic computer use.&#160; The speakers were a little quieter than I’d like and I’m still getting use to the touchpad which is a little more advanced than I’m use to using (and seems to force you to get use to it).&#160; </p>  <p><strong>Who would I recommend it to?</strong></p>  <p>Not me.&#160; If you’re a developer, not you.&#160; At least not now.&#160; The majority of people could certainly get by with just Chrome OS.&#160; If they’re willing to buy into the Googleverse (i.e. put all their info into Google).&#160; It might require someone to move from Microsoft Word to Google Docs, but that’s not as hard as some people might think.&#160; And in reality, it deals with the problem many people don’t think about which is backing up their data.&#160; Old people would be able to get by on a device like this easily once you explain or convince them not to worry about their data being in the cloud.&#160; If you think you do things you couldn’t do in the web, take a serious look at what you really could do.&#160; Every day new web sites are coming out that start replacing the functionality of those apps we never thought you could do in the web.</p>    <p><strong>Why is the power adapter delicious?</strong></p>  <p>Clearly the power adapter is amazingly tasty.&#160; My dog proved it.&#160; Thankfully it still works.</p>  <p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Pgpy3kgNq5A/Th5NOMWmuzI/AAAAAAAAA-k/HjXpdQSpuqE/s400/2011-07-13_21-57-38_671.jpg" /></p>
