<p><img style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; display: inline; float: right" title="CodeMash 2013" alt="CodeMash 2013" align="right" src="http://storage.chrisrisner.com/images/logo-codemash-2013.png" />A couple of weeks ago, I had the pleasure of flying to Detroit and then driving down to Sandusky, Ohio for <a title="CodeMash 2013" href="http://codemash.org/">CodeMash 2013</a>.&#160; CodeMash is probably the biggest conference in the midwest, has been going on since 2006, and covers development of all varieties.&#160; There are presentations on .NET, Java, Ruby, iOS, Android, web development, machine learning, and much more.&#160; It’s great attending CodeMash because you’re just about guaranteed to learn about something you have never looked at before.</p>  <p><a title="CodeMash 2012" href="http://chrisrisner.com/CodeMash-2012">Last year</a> I presented an introduction to Android.&#160; This was my first big presentation (outside of presenting to a large group of people at work, nearly all of whom I already knew) and it went pretty well.&#160; This time around, I gave two different presentations on <a title="Mobile Services" href="http://www.windowsazure.com/mobile">Windows Azure Mobile Services</a>.&#160; One of the presentations was on <a title="iOS and Windows Azure" href="http://www.windowsazure.com/ios">iOS and Mobile Services</a> and was similar to ones I’ve given recently (with a few new features).&#160; The other one was on Android and Mobile Services which was really exciting.&#160; The reason this was so exciting was that we don’t actually have an official SDK for Android yet.&#160; However, one of the Microsoft MVPs, <a title="Sasha&#39;s blog" href="http://blogs.microsoft.co.il/blogs/sasha/">Sasha Goldshtein</a>, created an Android SDK.&#160; This <em>unofficial</em> SDK is <a title="Mobile Services Android SDK" href="https://github.com/goldshtn/wams-android">available to download on GitHub</a> and actually gives you access to everything in Mobile Services.&#160; Using Sasha’s SDK, you can take advantage of asynchronous data storage, user authentication, and push notifications in addition to all of the server side features you get in Mobile Services.&#160; While we will have an official SDK out in due time, I’m going to make available the source code for the app I demonstrated in this presentation in case anyone wants to get started with it today (that should be coming soon).&#160; Both of my presentations went well though being stacked against the Bacon Bar did not work in my favor as far as attendance went.&#160; You can access the slides from my presentations here:</p>  <ul>   <li><a title="Android and Mobile Services at CodeMash" href="http://storage.chrisrisner.com/presentations/CodeMash-2013-BuildingAndroidAppsWithWindowsAzureMobileServices.pptx">Android and Mobile Services</a></li>    <li><a title="iOS and Mobile Services at CodeMash" href="http://storage.chrisrisner.com/presentations/CodeMash-2013-BuildingIOSappsWithWindowsAzureMobileServices.pptx">iOS and Mobile Services</a></li> </ul>  <p>Outside of the presentation, the conference was a lot of fun and a great success.&#160; We had set up a Windows Azure booth and I was able to talk to quite a few people about Windows Azure and Mobile Services which was great.&#160; Many people were blown away by all the things you can do with Windows Azure now (It’s not just Cloud Services anymore).&#160; I only made it to a couple of sessions but what I saw was great.&#160; The organizers did an amazing job and everyone that attended really kept with the CodeMash spirit.&#160; If I had one complaint, it would be the same as anyone else:&#160; the WiFi was horrific.&#160; It was pretty weird seeing how amazing the WiFi seemed to be last year and how poor it was this year.&#160; That being said, even that couldn’t prevent CodeMash 2013 from being a success.&#160; </p>
