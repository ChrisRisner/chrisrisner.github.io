I hope this doesn't indicate I'll have to give an additional one each year!&#160; This year the conference was in San Francisco at the Moscone center.&#160; I've been to Moscone twice before to attend Google I/O but I've always been in Moscone West.&#160; Build took place in North and South which were cool to see.&#160; Build was especially awesome for me because we announced the General Availability (GA) of Windows Azure Mobile Services (something I work on quite a bit).&#160; The sessions I delivered at Build were pretty interesting.&#160; One covered the many different ways and platforms you can take advantage of Mobile Services from.&#160; The second was a Protips session which covered a lot of the things that people ask about but we generally don't dive too deep into.&#160; </p>  <p><strong>Mobile Services is like…a big deal</strong></p>  <p>With less than a year having gone by since the launch of Mobile Services, the growth has been phenomenal.&#160; This was truly reflected by the amount of coverage present at Build.&#160; Mobile Services was mentioned in the day 1 keynote and demoed (by the very talented and British <a title="Josh Twist:  The Man, the Myth, the Brit" href="http://thejoyofcode.com">Josh Twist</a>) during the day 2 keynote.&#160; While I presented two sessions on it, there were 8 sessions showcasing or mentioning Mobile Services.&#160; You can check out all of the <a title="Mobile Services sessions and keynotes from Build 2013" href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2013?sort=sequential&amp;direction=desc&amp;term=&amp;t=mobile-services#theSessions">keynotes and sessions as well as their recorded videos here</a>.&#160;

and &quot;let's make sure everyone knows all of the platforms supported&quot;.&#160; I demonstrated the basics of Mobile Services, but I did it by first starting with a PhoneGap app running on iOS, then with a native Android application, and finished things off by showing a MonoTouch app running on iOS (re: c# on iOS).&#160; The real problem with a session like this is that you inherently can't dive super deep into any specific area or you lose the ability to cover the rest.&#160; As it was, I finished with JUST enough time for a few questions.&#160; Despite the lack of specific depth in this session, the feedback was great.&#160; It's hard to grasp just how accessible Mobile Services is and how easy it is to use from so many different development platforms.&#160;

With Mobile Services being so new, it's hard to land a presentation where it makes sense to really dive very deep into any specific area.&#160; With the general features of Mobile Services taking an hour to go over, it doesn't really leave much time for anything else.&#160; This session was the antithesis to this.&#160; Instead of going over any of the basics, I went through dozens of different &quot;how do I do this?&quot; type things.&#160; All the questions we regularly get where the response is &quot;You can do that, but it takes a bit more work&quot; and then we don't have time to talk about, were covered in this session.&#160; Oddly, I got feedback after the session that I should have also covered the basics of working with Mobile Services.&#160; I feel pretty strongly that if you walk into a session that starts with &quot;Protips&quot; you probably shouldn't expect a lot of basics.&#160; This session got a lot of great feedback (other than that) and some great questions at the end.&#160;

If you attended, either of my sessions, thank you.&#160; If not, you can watch them at your convenience now and let me know if you have any questions.</p>
