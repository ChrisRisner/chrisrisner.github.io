First we’ll create our UI project.&#160; After going into “Add New Project” we’re going to choose a “ASP .Net MVC 2 Empty Web Application”.&#160; If you haven’t used the MVC project template before, I strongly suggest creating a “ASP .Net MVC 2 Web Application” and understandubg how things work before proceeding.&#160; We’ll name our project “Veritas.UI.Web”.&#160; </p>  <p>Next we need to create our Business Layer and our Data Layer projects.&#160; So go to “Add New Project” and under “Windows” add a “Class Library” named “Veritas.BusinessLayer” and “Veritas.DataLayer”.&#160; After we’ve created these, we can go and add some references we’ll need later.&#160; The BusinessLayer project should reference the DataLayer.&#160; The UI should reference both the BusinessLayer and the DataLayer.&#160; Lastly, we need to add a “Test Project” (located under “Test”) which we’ll use for all of our unit and integration tests.&#160; Go ahead and name it “Veritas.Tests”.</p>  <p>The last thing we’ll do for today is remove some of the default files that were created that we don’t need.&#160; In the business and data layer projects, there will be a “Class1.cs” file that is generated.&#160; Go ahead and delete that.&#160; Once you’re done with that, do the same thing with “UnitTest1.cs” in the tests project.</p>  <p>So now we’re done with our solution and projects.&#160; In the next entry we’ll actually start doing some coding.&#160; If you’d like a look at the project structure as it should be so far, you can <a title="Download Veritas Part 4" href="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/Veritas Part 4.zip">download what we’ve done here</a>.</p>
