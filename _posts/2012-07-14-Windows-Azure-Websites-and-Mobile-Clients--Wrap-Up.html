<p><img style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; display: inline; float: right" title="Windows Azure" alt="Windows Azure" align="right" src="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/windowsazurevertical.jpg" />The goal of this mini-series was to create a backend hosted in Windows Azure Websites and connect to it from both Android and iOS.&#160; More so, I wanted to host something that didn’t require .NET technologies to work.&#160; I wanted to do this because, if you’re an iOS developer you are definitely on OSX.&#160; Many Android developers are using OSX for their primary development machine as well.&#160; This means that if you are forced to use a .NET backend, your hands are somewhat tied since you can’t run Visual Studio on OSX.&#160; For that reason, I chose to create a PHP website with a minimal web user interface and all of the functionality exposed via web services.&#160; The site and services were relatively simple and exposed the ability to <a title="URL Shortening" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL_shortening">shorten URLs</a> (just like <a title="TinyURL.com" href="http://tinyurl.com">tinyurl.com</a>).</p>  <p>As of now, we’ve successfully deployed this PHP website to <a title="Windows Azure Websites" href="https://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/home/scenarios/web-sites/">Windows Azure WebSites</a> as well as created clients for both iOS and Android.&#160; You can see each article in this mini-series here:</p>  <p><a title="Windows Azure Websites Part 1" href="http://chrisrisner.com/Windows-Azure-Websites-and-Mobile-Clients-Part-1--The-URL-Shortener">Part 1: Creating a site in Windows Azure Websites and uploading our PHP site</a></p>  <p><a title="Part 2 of Windows Azure Websites Mobile Clients" href="http://chrisrisner.com/Windows-Azure-Websites-and-Mobile-Clients-Part-2--The-PHP-Code">Part 2:&#160; A deep dive into the PHP code for a URL Shortening Service</a> </p>  <p><a title="Part 3 of Windows Azure Websites Mobile Clients" href="http://chrisrisner.com/Windows-Azure-Websites-and-Mobile-Clients-Part-3---The-iOS-Client">Part 3:&#160; Starting the iOS Client:&#160; Displaying a list of shortened URLs</a></p>  <p><a title="Part 4 of Windows Azure Websites Mobile Clients" href="http://chrisrisner.com/Windows-Azure-Websites-and-Mobile-Clients-Part-4--The-iOS-Client-Continued">Part 4:&#160; Continuing the iOS Client:&#160; Viewing the details of a shortened URL</a></p>  <p><a title="Part 6 of Windows Azure Websites Mobile Clients" href="http://chrisrisner.com/Windows-Azure-Websites-and-Mobile-Clients-Part-5--The-iOS-Client-Finished">Part 5:&#160; Finishing the iOS Client:&#160; Giving users the ability to insert new shortened URLs</a></p>  <p><a title="Part 6 of Windows Azure Websites Mobile Clients" href="http://chrisrisner.com/Windows-Azure-Websites-and-Mobile-Clients-Part-6--The-Android-Client">Part 6:&#160; Starting the Android Client:&#160; Displaying a list of shortened URLs</a></p>  <p><a title="Part 7 of Windows Azure Websites Mobile Clients" href="http://chrisrisner.com/Windows-Azure-Websites-and-Mobile-Clients-Part-7--The-Android-Client-Continued">Part 7:&#160; Continuing the Android Client:&#160; Viewing the details of a shortened URL</a></p>  <p><a title="Part 8 of Windows Azure Websites Mobile Clients" href="http://chrisrisner.com/Windows-Azure-Websites-and-Mobile-Clients-Part-8--The-Android-Client-Finished">Part 8:&#160; Finishing the Android Client:&#160; Giving users the ability to insert new shortened URLs</a></p>  <p>This demo was originally built for a Windows Azure DevCamp in London, England which was organized and hosted by the <a title="United Kingdom Windows Azure User Group" href="http://ukwaug.net/">United Kingdom Windows Azure User Group</a>.&#160; They did a great job and it was really fun to present there.&#160; You can grab the deck from <a title="London DevCamp 2012 Android Presentation" href="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/June-2012-London-DevCamp-Android.potx">my Android presentation here</a> and <a title="London DevCamp 2012 iOS Presentation" href="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/June-2012-London-DevCamp-iOS.potx">my iOS presentation here</a>.&#160; These presentations are mostly the same as the functionality used prior to Windows Azure Websites was (mostly) the same for both Android and iOS.&#160; Plus what I’ve done so far is about the same for both.&#160; What’s important is that we’ve just started to scratch the surface of Android and iOS connectivity to Windows Azure Websites.&#160; Stay tuned as we have some exciting stuff in store.</p>
