<p>Google has <a title="20% time" href="http://www.google.com/jobs/lifeatgoogle/englife/index.html">20% time</a>.&#160; Facebook has <a title="Hackathon" href="https://www.facebook.com/blog.php?post=2234227130">Hackathons</a>.&#160; LinkedIn has <a title="Hackdays" href="http://blog.linkedin.com/category/linkedin-hackdays/">Hackdays</a>.&#160; It seems that more and more companies are trying to entice engineers to work for them by showcasing the freedom they’re willing to give employees.&#160; Typically this comes in the form of giving them free time to work on projects that might not be company priorities.&#160; In the case of Google, the projects their employees work on have ended as serious products (Gmail, Google Suggest, Orkut).&#160; For Facebook they’ve added real features to their site (Chat, Friend Suggester).&#160; It’s clear that the time and trust the leaders of these companies show in their employees isn’t just getting spent playing Xbox and drinking.</p>  <p>Recently at my <a title="www.quickenloans.com" href="http://www.google.com/jobs/lifeatgoogle/englife/index.html">work</a> they rolled out something like this.&#160; We’re essentially being given 10% free time.&#160; That’s 4 hours a week (ok most people don’t really work 40 hours but that’s the “officially budgeted time”) to spend on any project I want.&#160; It’s only been a short time but some of the people there have already started to get out great things.&#160; It’s really nice to work at a mortgage companies where numbers are important and be given the opportunity to do something where you can’t really measure success with numbers.</p>  <p><img style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; display: inline; float: right" title="GATE" alt="GATE" align="right" src="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/gate.png" />I’ve been using this time for something quite un-mortgage related but something I’ve been meaning to spend time researching for a long time:&#160; <a title="Natural Language Processing" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing">Natural Language Processing</a>.&#160; I had previously (about 3 years ago) spent a small amount of time looking at <a title="Proxem&#39;s Antelope" href="http://www.proxem.com/Default.aspx?tabid=119">Proxem’s Antelope platform</a>.&#160; While tempted to return to working with this, Antelope is a .Net framework and I’ve been doing a lot of Java lately (ok I haven’t done any .net in a while).&#160; Between working on <a title="Detroit Restaurant Week" href="http://chrisrisner.com/Detroit-Restaurant-Week--My-First-Android-App">Android Apps</a> at home and at work, experimenting with JBoss, and the desire to learn more open source systems, I wanted to look into Java based NLP.&#160; Fortunately, I found the <a title="GATE" href="http://gate.ac.uk/">GATE platform</a>.&#160; For those of you that didn’t bother to read the link above, Natural Language Processing is all about taking normal human speech and making it so a computer can understand it.&#160; If you think about it, most of what you say (or think) doesn’t follow easy to understand rules.&#160; It’s not like math.&#160; Math is something that computers are exceptionally suited to understanding.&#160; Math is rational.&#160; Human speech is incredibly far from that.&#160; So if you think about that, you begin to understand how difficult it is to make a computer understand the things you say or write.&#160; A pretty cool example of something that has been done recently, and somewhat famously, in the field of Natural Language Processing is the <a title="IBM&#39;s Watson" href="http://ibm.com/watson">Watson system that IBM built</a> to compete on Jeopardy.&#160; Watson used NLP to understand the questions being read (written in it’s case) and then figure out what was being asked so it would know how to answer.&#160; I don’t think I’ll get to that level anytime (soon) but so far it’s been great to learn about it.</p>
