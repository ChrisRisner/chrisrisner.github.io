No, this article isn’t going to go on and on about Tiger…..there’s been plenty of talking heads spewing that story. It’s about how many bitches does it take? Seriously? Throughout time many men of societal status (money, power, fame, etc) have been caught nailing everything in sight. So this Tiger situation made me wonder – how many bitches does it take? Is there an actual number/answer? I ask you to ask yourself – how many bitches (or tools) does it take for you?</p>  <p>So far it’s 10 for Tiger…..and counting. It seems he got skanks one through four to zip it…I would guess he paid for their silence. BUT - <i>How could you NOT get five through eighty eight thousand to shut it for cash??</i> YOU’VE GOT VIDEO GAMES AND SHIT NAMED AFTER YOU – YOU’RE EFFING TIGER WOODS!!! OPEN UP THE VAULT YOU CHEAP FUCK.</p>  <p>With each day/hour that passes more and more bitches be comin out the woodwork with stories saying Tiger has treated them like a pin cushion - or Tiger likes to go ass shopping at the Waffle Houses around central Florida – or Tiger likes to drop some Ambien and body board chicks…in a waterbed. (whatever the fuck that means…Ambien sex? WTF?) One thing I take from all these accusations is that Tiger is ascending toward prolific status in a hurry. NOT Wilt Chamberlin prolific though…that dude got massive amounts of poo poo.</p>  <p><a onclick="return hs.expand(this)" class="highslide" href="http://sammichnow.com/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/HowmanyBitches_13B49/clip_image002_2.jpg"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 15px 10px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="clip_image002" border="0" alt="clip_image002" align="right" src="http://sammichnow.com/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/HowmanyBitches_13B49/clip_image002_thumb.jpg" width="220" height="244" /></a></p>  <p>Pick the right caption:</p>  <p><i>A) </i><i><u>Try multiplying that number by another 100 homeboy….then you’re in the neighborhood</u></i></p>  <p><i>B) </i><i><u>100 points, 100 bitches, 28 rebounds – 48 minutes.</u></i></p>  <p><i>C) </i><i><u>The number of rubbers needed for a typical weekend….in 1963. </u></i></p>  <p>I’m talking Tiger is getting some Clinton like action lately…..meaning…..there has been a solid run, an apex and a free fall decent. You jackass Bill…..look at that pig…..there isn’t enough scotch in Scotland to……..whatever.</p>  <p><a onclick="return hs.expand(this)" class="highslide" href="http://sammichnow.com/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/HowmanyBitches_13B49/clip_image003_2.jpg"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="clip_image003" border="0" alt="clip_image003" src="http://sammichnow.com/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/HowmanyBitches_13B49/clip_image003_thumb.jpg" width="184" height="244" /></a></p>  <p><i><u>(Said under his breath) “Here’s the plan, me, you, a dark office, my busted zipper, and a sack of 10 from white castle”. </u></i></p>  <p>It is starting to take some creepy turns though…..one woman accused Tiger of loving late night ambien sex romps…..ambien being the sleeping drug. Another woman is rumored to be a porn star…..and not a good one either (think about that). A waffle house waitress. A <u>trashy</u> lingerie model. A VIP waitress in a Vegas club (OK, I can see that one – never under estimate the power of a self inflicted roofie). Etc, etc. These are things we hear and all collectively choose to not believe because we don’t want to believe – I mean, we’re talking about Tiger. No way right? He’s got a smoking wife. He’s the man above all other men in the golf world. A Winner. A Recluse. Makes $100M a year. A God to the sports world. ETC. ETC.</p>  <p>But didn’t we once say the exact same things about this man?</p>  <p><a onclick="return hs.expand(this)" class="highslide" href="http://sammichnow.com/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/HowmanyBitches_13B49/clip_image005_2.jpg"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="clip_image005" border="0" alt="clip_image005" src="http://sammichnow.com/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/HowmanyBitches_13B49/clip_image005_thumb.jpg" width="165" height="244" /></a></p>  <p><i>Yeeeeees.</i></p>  <p>Say it ain’t so Tiger.
