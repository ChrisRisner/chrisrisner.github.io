<p><img style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; display: inline" src="http://storage.chrisrisner.com/images/ToughMudder2014Ice.jpg" width="379" align="right" height="253" />This past weekend I had the pleasure of running the Seattle <a title="Tough Mudder" href="https://toughmudder.com/">Tough Mudder</a>.&#160; If you don’t know what the Tough Mudder is, it’s considered an “obstacle race”.&#160; After having run it, just calling it an “obstacle race” is like just calling a <a title="McLaren F1" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren_F1">McLaren F1</a> just a car.&#160; This is a long (11+ mile) run with some pretty tough (designed by British special forces) obstacles.&#160; 25+ of those obstacles too.&#160; A small few of the obstacles are fairly simple and anyone in reasonable shape can traverse them.&#160; However, most of them are built with teamwork in mind.&#160; Some of them are built in such a way that getting through them without help is near impossible.&#160; Outside of having a few friends tell me not to worry about not going into the event with a team, I really didn’t know what to expect from this.</p>  <p><strong>The Pep Talk</strong></p>  <p>I wanted to start as early as possible to make sure I’d be able to finish and get home at a reasonable time so, despite being assigned a start time of 12:20, I rolled in early enough to start with the first wave just before 8am.&#160; When they call your wave (these races go in waves), you head over to a warm up area where you’re taken through a few basic moves to get warm and then you head to a start area (just for added awesome, there is a climbing wall you have to go over before you even get to the start area).&#160; Once there, an MC gathers all the people starting in the wave in a circle.&#160; What comes next can only be described as a pep talk on steroids.&#160; I’ve done races before so usually what you get at this point is a “Is everyone ready to run?&#160; YAY!&#160; Are you guys going to kick butt?&#160; YAY!&#160; Who’s a pretty princess? YAY!”&#160; This was different.&#160; First the MC asked people to raise their hand if it was their first mudder, their second, their 5th, and so on.&#160; For some this was the tenth time they’d done one of these events.&#160; You can tell how many times a person has gone through mudders by the color and text on their headband.&#160; First timers get an orange headband, second timers get green, third blue, and so on.&#160; The MC was wearing a band that denoted he’d done 25+ Tough Mudders.&#160; After identifying people, the talk turned to teamwork.&#160; </p>  <p>When you start a Tough Mudder, you all become a team.&#160; Every person.&#160; It doesn’t matter if you showed up alone or with a group of 10 friends, you’re now on a team with 50+ people.&#160; Really though, you’re on a team with every single other runner participating in the event.&#160; And the MC reinforces that.&#160; He asked the Legionnaires (those who have completed 2+ mudders) to help the first timers.&#160; This was reiterated several times.&#160; As was the seriousness of some of the obstacles.&#160; If you have a heart condition, don’t run through live wires with exposed ends (that should be obvious but…).&#160; Also, there’s no shame in skipping obstacles and how long it takes you to run the race doesn’t matter.&#160; With something like a 78% completion rate, it’s all about finishing the Tough Mudder and getting your headband, not how fast you do it in.&#160; They don’t have a starting clock or a finishing clock anywhere.&#160; The Tough Mudder is big on promoting and fundraising for the <a title="Tough Mudder and Wounded Warrior Project" href="https://toughmudder.com/wounded-warrior-project">Wounded Warrior Project</a>, so on top of having many members of the military there for the event, the first wave’s pep talk ends with singing the national anthem.&#160; After that, they count down, and then, you go.</p>  <p><strong>I didn’t get it</strong></p>  <p>The pep talk was pretty cool, but I didn’t really get it yet.&#160; Yeah, we’re a team.&#160; If I see someone fall down, I’m going to make sure they’re not dead.&#160; Whatever.&#160; We got started running and it wasn’t that bad.&#160; Three miles in and things were going ok.&#160; Just a couple obstacles so far (most of them are in the last quarter of the race) and I was feeling fine.&#160; I even made it over a few walls without any help.&#160; Close to the third mile as we were running around a pond, I got into the same cadence as a group of three guys who were running as a team.&#160; As we approached 3.5, we were getting close to the Warrior Carry.&#160; This obstacle has one mudder carry the other for half of the distance and then they trade off.&#160; As we got close, I heard the three guys call from behind me, “Hey green shirt!”&#160; What followed was an invitation to join up for the event since they needed a fourth to get through the obstacle.&#160; That was nice and saved me having to wait for someone to show up alone at the Carry so I graciously agreed and exchanged names with them.&#160; At one of the next next few obstacles I lost track of those three guys but continued on.</p>  <p><strong>Like a Ton of Bricks</strong></p>  <p>Somewhere around the 4 mile point in mid trail run, I could hear someone breathing heavy as they came up running behind me. Without looking behind me I heard a woman say “Sorry I’m breathing like a train”.&#160; My response was “no worries, it’s better than not breathing at all.”&#160; We carried on a brief conversation while continuing to run.&#160; “Is this your first mudder?”&#160; “How did you train?”&#160; “I’m really unprepared for this.”&#160; That sort of thing.&#160; Then we got on the topic of teamwork and how this event was different from other races we’ve done (obstacle or not).&#160; We were both so pleased to be doing an event where how fast you ran it wasn’t important, it was about finishing and helping other people finish.&#160; <strong>Then she said something that hit me like a ton of bricks, “It’s like how people should be in normal life.”</strong>&#160; Holy crap!&#160; It’s so simple.&#160; When was the last time you just stopped and made sure someone else could finish something?&#160; When was the last time you reached your hand out to someone you’ve never met before?&#160; Too often in life, it’s all about how good we can do personally and how quickly we can finish.&#160; I’m not advocating that competition is a bad thing, but perhaps to much of an all the time thing.&#160; We compete against other companies, our friends, our coworkers (some places actually call these <strong>teammates</strong>), and even ourselves.&#160; What if instead of always doing that, we thought about bringing everyone across the finish line?</p>  <p><strong>Proving a point</strong></p>  <p>Ok so so far it’s not like I had helped or been helped that much.&#160; Shortly afterwards that started changing.&#160; Around mile 5.5 I rolled my ankle for the second time.&#160; The first time I just stumbled a bit.&#160; This time I flat out fell on a hill I was running down.&#160; Ow.&#160; No one was immediately near me when it happened but by the time I had gotten up and started to limp to the side of the trail, the same woman and then several other people caught up to me.&#160; Every single one offered help, asked if I needed a medic, an arm to lean on, or anything else.&#160; Being stubborn (stupid) I said I was fine and just needed to walk it off.&#160; So I did and continued on.&#160; At about mile 8, the three guys I had run into earlier caught up with me.&#160; I was sufficiently recovered that I was more or less running normally (plus a healthy dose of pain).&#160; We resume some light banter as we continued running.&#160; </p>  <p>Somewhere just past mile 9, I rolled the ankle again.&#160; This time I went down hard.&#160; We were right by another obstacle: 3 climbing walls of increasing height.&#160; The guys helped me back to my feet and the medic that was at the obstacle asked if I needed help.&#160; I said it was the third time I’d rolled it but I thought I’d be fine.&#160; I looked at the medic and her face was easy to read as she said, “You just want to finish don’t you?”&#160;&#160; It was a face that said, “You’re a moron.&#160; I hope you don’t break it.”&#160; At that point there was about zero chance I was going to do those walls on my own.&#160; Even the first at six feet would have been tough on a pretty bum ankle.&#160; My three new friends made sure I made it over at their own expense.&#160; We worked as a team.&#160; That continued at every single obstacle that required any modicum of teamwork for the rest of the event.&#160; Not to mention the <a title="Pyramid Scheme" href="https://toughmudder.com/content/pyramid-scheme">Pyramid Scheme</a> where you pretty much HAVE to crawl over each other to get to the top and then pull the last person up.&#160; When was the last time a complete stranger just let you walk over their back to reach their shoulders so you could reach the top?</p>  <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>  <p>As I said before, I’m not saying we should abandon all thoughts of competition and being our best.&#160; These concepts have their merits and help us get better.&#160; But we could all stand to take a step back and see what we can do to work better with our teammates, with our partners, and with our friends.&#160; Try making things about getting everyone there and not just about getting there first.&#160; Doing the Tough Mudder helped open my eyes a little bit and I hope that in the future I can act more like a teammate and less like an individual.&#160; </p>
