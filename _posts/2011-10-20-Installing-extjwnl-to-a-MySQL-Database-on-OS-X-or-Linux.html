<p><img style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; display: inline; float: right" align="right" src="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/extjwnl1.png" />Recently I’ve been doing a lot of experimenting with <a title="Natural Language Processing" href="http://chrisrisner.com/Getting-through-the-GATE--Innovation-Time-for-Everyone">Natural Language Processing (NLP)</a>.&#160; One of the goals, or maybe necessities of the program I’m working on is having the ability to look up the definition of words it doesn’t understand.&#160; While most of the time, if I’m not sure how to spell a word or am looking for the definition, I just rely on Google.&#160; However, for a running computer program that will have an undetermined (and probably excessive) amount of input, it wouldn’t be very efficient to go to Google multiple times a second (<a title="Google Search API Limits" href="http://code.google.com/apis/soapsearch/api_faq.html#tech7">plus google would frown on that</a>).&#160; Enter <a title="WordNet" href="http://wordnet.princeton.edu/">WordNet</a>.&#160; WordNet is a lexical database of words.&#160; Nouns, verbs, adjectives..OH MY!&#160; (Yes, WordNet is much more than JUST words and definitions, but for now we’ll stick with the words) On it’s own, WordNet is just a group of files that has all of this information in it, however, there are <a title="Implementations of WordNet" href="http://wordnet.princeton.edu/wordnet/related-projects">many different implementations of WordNet available</a>.&#160; </p>  <p>As I’ve been <a title="GATE in Java" href="http://chrisrisner.com/Getting-through-the-GATE--Innovation-Time-for-Everyone">experimenting with GATE in Java</a>, I wanted a Java extension of WordNet.&#160; The first one I looked at was <a title="JWordNet Library" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jwordnet/">JWNL (or Java WordNet Library)</a>.&#160; Unfortunately, I ran into a lot of problems getting the JWNL library working.&#160; After getting frustrated enough to look for something else, I found <a title="extJWNL" href="http://extjwnl.sourceforge.net/">extJWNL</a>, which, according to the <a title="WordNet Libraries" href="http://wordnet.princeton.edu/wordnet/related-projects/">WordNet site</a> is an updated version of JWNL.&#160; As I mentioned before, Wordnet, comes as just flat files with the data in them.&#160; extJWNL comes with the code to accessing these files as well as for accessing the data if it’s in a database.&#160; In addition (and perhaps critical given the code for accessing via the database) are scripts and code to insert all of the WordNet data into a database.&#160; Unfortunately, extJWNL seems to be scripted ONLY for windows.&#160; Up until the recent past, this wouldn’t phase me.&#160; However, at work I’m primarily using an OS X computer which means I needed to find a way to make this work.&#160; If you look at the dict2db.bat file, you can find what it’s really doing:</p>  <p align="left">%JAVACMD% %JAVA_OPTS% %EXTRA_JVM_ARGUMENTS% -classpath %CLASSPATH_PREFIX%;%CLASSPATH% -Dapp.name=&quot;dict2db&quot; -Dapp.repo=&quot;%REPO%&quot; -Dbasedir=&quot;%BASEDIR%&quot; net.sf.extjwnl.utilities.DictionaryToDatabase %CMD_LINE_ARGS%</p>  <p>If you care to look and figure out what get’s sent into the script file you can then figure out what’s being put in all the parameters.&#160; Or you can look at this which I used to actually run the code:</p>  <p>java -classpath <strong>lib/extjwnl-1.6.2.jar:lib/commons-logging-1.1.1.jar:lib/mysql-connector-java-5.1.17.jar:lib/extjwnl-utilities-1.6.2.jar</strong> -Dapp.name=&quot;dict2db&quot; -Dapp.repo=&quot;<strong>lib</strong>&quot; -Dbasedir=&quot;<strong>/</strong>&quot; net.sf.extjwnl.utilities.DictionaryToDatabase <strong>src/extjwnl/main/resources/net/sf/extjwnl/file_properties.xml</strong> <strong>src/utilities/main/sql/create.sql com.mysql.jdbc.Driver jdbc:mysql://localhost/newwordnet</strong></p>  <p>The important things here are:</p>  <p>1.&#160; The list of jar files (colon separated)</p>  <p>2.&#160; The repo and base directory location (since this line was run from the root extjwnl directory, we used “lib” and “/” respectively&quot;)</p>  <p>3.&#160; The path the to file properties file.&#160; This file is part of the extjwnl zip and you MUST alter it to point to where ever you have installed WordNet before running this.</p>  <p>4.&#160; the location of the create.sql file.&#160; Again this file is part of the extjwnl zip.</p>  <p>5.&#160; The mysql jdbc driver name and database path.&#160; In this example, I created a database named newwordnet and gave the anonymous user complete access to the database for the purposes of running this.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>Once you’ve done that, sit back and watch as it enlightens you with multiple table creations and data insertions.&#160; A few minutes later, you’ll be database driven and ready to go.</p>
