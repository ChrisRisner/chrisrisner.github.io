A while back in June, I [tweeted](https://twitter.com/chrisrisner/status/614491780130717697) the words "Analysis Paralysis".  At the time I was starting to think about building a new mobile app.  As you might imagine given what I do for a living, I wanted to use Azure as the backend for the app and I wanted to be able to publish it for Android, iOS, and Windows Phone.  The question I was grappling with was how did I want to build the app.  

##How to build an app
If you've been building mobile apps for any reasonable amount of time, then you know there are options when it comes to the technology that you can use.  If you know all about this already, go ahead and skip on.  When people first started building apps for iPhones, Androids, and Windows Phones, they built what we would consider *native* apps.  For Android, this meant using Java (or at least *Androidized Java*).  For iOS, this meant using Objective-C.  And for Windows Phone, this meant C# (or Visual Basic...I think that was added at some point).  Initially this was the only way to build a mobile application on these platforms.
