A while back in June, I [tweeted](https://twitter.com/chrisrisner/status/614491780130717697) the words "Analysis Paralysis".  At the time I was starting to think about building a new mobile app.  As you might imagine given what I do for a living, I wanted to use Azure as the backend for the app and I wanted to be able to publish it for Android, iOS, and Windows Phone.  The question I was grappling with was how did I want to build the app.  

##How to build an app
If you've been building mobile apps for any reasonable amount of time, then you know there are options when it comes to the technology that you can use.  If you know all about this already, go ahead and skip on.  When people first started building apps for iPhones, Androids, and Windows Phones, they built what we would consider *native* apps.  For Android, this meant using Java (or at least *Androidized Java*).  For iOS, this meant using Objective-C.  And for Windows Phone, this meant C# (or Visual Basic...I think that was added at some point).  Initially this was the only way to build a mobile application on these platforms.  

Later on, other approaches came to building mobile applications.  In [2009 at a iPhoneDevCamp](http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Application-Development/PhoneGap-Simplifies-iPhone-Android-BlackBerry-Development-788189), what would eventually become Apache Cordova.  This technology allowed developers to build iOS and Android applications using HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS.  Through a 'bridge', the JavaScript is able to call into the backend native code and APIs.  In this way, someone that is more familar with traditional web development is able to build a mobile application that still has native capabilities (think camera, GPS, sensors, connectivity to other installed apps, etc).  At some later point, Windows Phone support was added enabling developers to deliver the same application on the three major platforms (ok maybe Blackberry was available at some point as well).  Famously in [September of 2012, Mark Zuckerberg (of Facebook fame), said that HTML5 wasn't ready for mobile apps](http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/11/mark-zuckerberg-our-biggest-mistake-with-mobile-was-betting-too-much-on-html5/).  At the time, they were using technology very similar to Apache Cordova for their mobile Facebook app.  They started moving away from using HTML5 and instead building native apps.  Not entirely relevant to this post, but a few months later in December, [Sencha introduced Fastbook](https://www.sencha.com/blog/the-making-of-fastbook-an-html5-love-story/) which was a proof of concept to proove that an efficiently running mobile app could e built with HTML5.
