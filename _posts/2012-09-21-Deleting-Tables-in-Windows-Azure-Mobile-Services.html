<p><img style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; display: inline; float: right" align="right" src="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/mobile-service-logo-3.png" />A few people have run into issues with finding how to delete a table in Windows Azure Mobile Services.&#160; It’s actually very easy to accomplish though can be troublesome to find.&#160; In order to delete a table, start by logging into the <a title="Windows Azure Portal" href="http://manage.windowsazure.com">Windows Azure portal</a>.&#160; In the left hand navigation, select Mobile Services and then choose your app:</p>  <p align="center"><img title="Mobile Services Navigation" alt="Mobile Services Navigation" src="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/mobile-services-select-app.jpg" /></p>  <p>Once you’ve selected your mobile service, you’ll be on the dashboard for your app.&#160; Select <strong>Data</strong> from the top bar of links:</p>  <p align="center"><img src="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/mobile-services-select-data.jpg" /></p>  <p>After selecting the <strong>Data</strong> tab, you’ll see a list of your tables.&#160; You need to click on a table but not the area with the table name.&#160; Clicking on a table name (or the blue area) will take you to a view for that specific table.&#160; Instead you need to tap to the right of the table name area under <strong>Indexs</strong> or <strong>Records</strong>:</p>

<p>Once you’ve done that and selected a table, you should now see a Delete button at the bottom:</p>

<p>Tapping that will roll up a confirmation question:</p>

<p>Clicking yes will allow you to finally delete the table.&#160; </p>
