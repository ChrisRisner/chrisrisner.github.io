<p><a onclick="return hs.expand(this)" class="highslide" href="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/634003144233522332.jpg"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 10px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="Veritas" border="0" alt="Veritas" align="right" src="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/634003144233522332.jpg" width="195" height="36" /></a> After a recent conversation with <a title="The Senator" href="http://stavos.homeip.net">the Senator</a>, I decided that there wasn’t really a bad reason (yet) to enable notifications to be sent out letting people know when people comment after them on blog entries.&#160; So now, when you go to comment on the blog, you’ll see a new checkbox with the text “Email me responses” next to it.&#160; In short, if you check this box, you will then be emailed when someone comments after you on a particular entry.&#160; Now I know what you’re thinking, “What if some jackass put’s my email address in and says that they want to get emailed?”&#160;&#160; Every email that goes out to let you know that someone commented after you includes a link which will allow you to cease any more emails from coming to you.&#160; Just a warning though, for the time being, once you’ve clicked on that link, you won’t get any emails for any entries.&#160; You will essentially be Opted Out from any emails.&#160; If you decide down the road that you actually do want to hear back about something, you’ll have to let me know personally (until I devise some more advanced system).&#160; Happy commenting!</p>  <p>Note:&#160; if you’re wondering about the “Veritas” pic.&#160; Veritas is the name I’ve given to the Blog Engine I’ve created which at some point in time, I might make publically available.</p>
