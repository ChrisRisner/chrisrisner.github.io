<p><img style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; display: inline; float: right" align="right" src="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/erin_and_chris_wdding.jpg" width="250" height="444" />My site has been pretty dead as of late.&#160; However, it’s for a pretty damn good reason (well, depending on who you ask):&#160; I got married.&#160; </p>  <p>Two years ago in November, I asked my fiancée to marry me and she was foolish enough to say yes.&#160; When we couldn’t decide to get married in Michigan, where I am from, or Arizona, where she is from, we decided on somewhere completely different: Kauai in Hawaii.&#160; </p>  <p>We couldn’t invite a lot of people but we were very fortunate that so many people were able to come and join us.&#160; On Sunday, March 11th Erin and I were joined in what I’m assured was an official ceremony (as long as our marriage does not run for President).&#160; It was raining on the day of the wedding but as you can see from the picture, things were still beautiful.&#160; Afterwards, we stayed in Kauai for our honeymoon and had a fantastic time there.&#160; We stayed at the fanciest hotel either of us have ever been to (the Princeville St Regis), hiked down to a natural ocean pool (that many people have died trying to swim in), went on a boat and plane tour, tried out paddle boarding and surfing, and just totally had a blast.&#160; If you’re thinking about going to Hawaii, I’d recommend Kauai (even though I haven’t been to the other islands yet).&#160; </p>  <p>On the beer front, Kauai doesn’t really get a lot of craft beers imported.&#160; They do, however, have a few local breweries.&#160; Of particular note is the <a title="Coconut Porter from Maui Brewing Company" href="http://mauibrewingco.com/flagship-beer/">Coconut Porter from Maui Brewing Company</a> and <a title="Hapa Ale" href="http://hawaiinuibrewing.com/beers/hapa-brown-ale/">Hawaii Nui Brewing’s Hapa Ale</a>.&#160; I’m not really sure if there is anywhere stateside that you can get these but if you have a chance, I’d recommend them.&#160; Deserving of an honorable mention was <a title="Kona Brewing Company" href="http://konabrewingco.com/">Kona Brewing Company’s Longboard Lager and Big Wave Golden Ale</a>.</p>
