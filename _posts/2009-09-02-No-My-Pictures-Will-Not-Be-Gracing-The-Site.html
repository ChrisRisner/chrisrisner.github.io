<p>Despite Greg’s desire for semi-nude pictures of me to display the progress I’ll be making doing P90X, it just won’t be happening.&#160; I’m not embarrassed in the slightest at my appearance (especially compared to a year ago) but the number of people that want to see that are in the gross minority (and possibly just gross in general).&#160; </p>  <p>That being said, the P90X train continues.&#160; Yesterday I woke up early in the day and did the Pylometrics before work.&#160; I then went running and lifting at lunch time.&#160; That proved to kick my ass as I am now sore as hell.&#160; Sore to the point that doing the Shoulders and Arms workout today was pretty rough.&#160; I can definitely tell it’s doing something though as I’m sore in places I’ve never been before (if you snickered, you live in a gutter).&#160; Tomorrow is Yoga which should be interesting as I’ve never done it before.&#160; </p>  <p>In other news, there was a close encounter with <a href="http://atomicinternet.homeip.net/news.asp?startat=article&amp;article=1004">Atomic</a> yesterday.&#160; So close it almost resulted in an Atomic shaped dent in the front hood of my <a href="http://chrisrisner.com/My-Fleet-Grows">2nd car</a>.&#160; Despite his insistence that we join him and his neighbor / lover for a game of frisbee (I’m convinced they would have somehow roofied the disc which would have gotten to us) we successfully avoided it and returned home to watch more of the first season of Lost.</p>
