<p><img style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; display: inline; float: right" title="CocoaConf" alt="CocoaConf" align="right" src="http://storage.chrisrisner.com/images/cocoaconf-vertical-logo.jpg" width="64" height="386" />This weekend I attended <a title="CocoaConf" href="http://cocoaconf.com/">CocoaConf</a> DC.&#160; This was my first time at a CocoaConf and my experience was absolutely incredible!&#160; CocoaConf is a series of conferences all about iPhone, iPad, and Mac development.&#160; I first heard of CocoaConf about a year and a half ago when my friend and former teammate, <a title="Adam&#39;s Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/adamkaump">Adam</a>, went to CocoaConf Columbus (in Ohio).&#160; I wasn’t all that interested in attending at the time but after <a title="Working at Microsoft" href="http://chrisrisner.com/Returning-from-Whence-I-Came!">switching jobs</a>, I started doing a lot more iOS development as well as presenting to iOS audiences.&#160; Thanks to the organizer of CocoaConf, <a title="Dave&#39;s Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/daveklein">Dave Klein</a>, I had the opportunity to present at the DC version of CocoaConf.&#160; </p>  <p>It’s always interesting being “the Microsoft guy” at an iOS conference or user group.&#160; When talking with people and you tell them you work at Microsoft, the reaction ranges from jaw-dropping shock to well guarded jaw-dropping shock.&#160; However, once I have a chance to talk to people about what I work on and talk about (<a title="Windows Azure Mobile Services for iOS" href="http://www.windowsazure.com/ios">Mobile Services</a>) they’re consistently blown away by how much support we’re putting out there for iOS.&#160; Thankfully at CocoaConf, I had the ability to share this story with a lot of people.&#160; While I didn’t have a lot of attendees at my actual session (what do you expect when you’re up against <a title="Jack Cox Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/jcox_mobile">Jack Cox</a> talking about auto-layout and <a title="borkware" href="https://twitter.com/borkware">Mark “borkware” Dalrymple</a> talking about headers) I probably spoke with twice as many developers outside of the session.&#160; The community at CocoaConf is absolutely amazing.&#160; Everyone is willing and happy to talk about tech and open to hearing about things they normally don’t (like saying iOS and Microsoft in the same sentence).&#160; I can easily say that I’ve never had conversations at a conference like the ones I had this past weekend.&#160; In addition, I was able to meet a ton of great speakers and iOS luminaries.&#160; It’s not every day you meet people like <a title="Ray Wenderlich" href="https://twitter.com/rwenderlich">Ray Wenderlich</a>, <a title="Jaimee&#39;s twitter" href="https://twitter.com/jaimeejaimee">Jaimee Newberry</a>,&#160; <a title="Jeff&#39;s Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/jeff_lamarche">Jeff LeMarche</a>, <a title="Dan&#39;s twitter" href="https://twitter.com/dimsumthinking">Daniel Steinberg</a>, <a title="Bill&#39;s twitter" href="https://twitter.com/bdudney">Bill Dudney</a>, and more!</p>  <p>If you’re an iOS or Mac developer, I can’t suggest the CocoaConf conferences enough.&#160; There are still two CocoaConfs coming up: one in <a title="Dallas CocoaConf" href="http://cocoaconf.com/dallas-2013/home">Dallas</a> and one in <a title="CocoaConf San Jose" href="http://cocoaconf.com/sanjose-2013/home">San Jose</a>.&#160; Hopefully they’ll soon announce conferences for the fall as well.&#160; I had a lot of fun at CocoaConf and would happily return anytime in the future.&#160; For anyone that attended my session (or didn’t) and would like access to the slides, you can grab them <a title="CocoaConf DC 2013 Slides" href="http://storage.chrisrisner.com/presentations/CocoaConf-DC-2013.pptx">here</a>.&#160; Additionally, you can view the videos I mentioned of <a title="Brent Simmons talks iOS and Mobile Services" href="http://www.windowsazure.com/ios">Brent Simmons talking Mobile Services here</a>.&#160; Good luck to everyone in Dallas and San Jose, I can’t wait to be at CocoaConf again!&#160; Thanks again to Dave for having me out.</p>
