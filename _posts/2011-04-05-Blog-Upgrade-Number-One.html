<p>I’ve been blogging off and on for the past few months about rewriting my blog framework, <a title="Veritas" href="http://chrisrisner.com/Category/Veritas">Veritas</a>.&#160; Today, I can happily say that I’m done(ish).&#160; What you’re reading right now is being hosted by the fruits of my labor and my upgraded, MVC2, .Net 4.0 blog engine.&#160; There is still some work I will eventually do but the site is pretty solid right now.&#160; I left off <a title="Veritas UI" href="http://chrisrisner.com/Veritas%E2%80%93Continuing-the-UI%E2%80%93Part-12">talking about the UI</a> and didn’t really get to the last piece which was the actual blog entry display.&#160; I finished that off without writing about it and then also finished the whole admin section as well.&#160; If and when I have the time, or if enough people are clamoring for it, I’ll talk about those things as well.&#160; In the mean time, you can still read all about the majority of the site and check out the code for yourself.&#160; Up next I still have a lot of stuff to talk about regarding my Android Application and the experience I’ve had making it.&#160; In the mean time, you can download the <a title="Veritas Source Code" href="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/Veritas 3 Almost Complete.zip">current full source to the site here</a>.</p>
