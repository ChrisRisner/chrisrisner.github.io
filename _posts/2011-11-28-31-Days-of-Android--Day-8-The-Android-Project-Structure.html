<p><img style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; display: inline; float: right" src="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/android_day_seven_directory.png" />Today we’ll look at the project structure and file organization for an Android project.&#160; This is something that we could have covered earlier in the <a title="31 Days of Android" href="http://chrisrisner.com/31-Days-of-Android">31 Days of Android series</a> though it wasn’t entirely necessary.&#160; We’ll go folder by folder to explain what is in our most recent <strong>DaySeven </strong>project.</p>  <p><strong>src</strong>-This folder contains our actual source code.&#160; In this project we haven’t broken things down further into different namespaces, though normally this would be recommended.&#160; You can see an example of how Google has broken things down into different namespaces in their <a title="Google IO 2011 Source" href="http://code.google.com/p/iosched/source/browse/#hg%2Fandroid%2Fsrc%2Fcom%2Fgoogle%2Fandroid%2Fapps%2Fiosched%2Fio">Google IO 2011 app here</a>.&#160; In this example they have a <strong>ui </strong>namespace which is then split into namespaces for different device types (<strong>phone</strong>, <strong>tablet</strong>, etc).&#160; </p>  <p><strong>gen</strong>-This contains files generated by Eclipse / Android.&#160; Specifically here we see <strong>R.java</strong>.&#160; If you recall from when you were accessing the IDs of elements in our layout, you did so using <strong>R.id.name</strong>.&#160; This is where those IDs are put into code so that you can access tehm.</p>  <p><strong>Android 2.2</strong>-This folder actually contains our reference to the Android SDK.</p>  <p><strong>assets</strong>-The assets folder is a location you can put raw files that you don’t need ID access to (so you can’t access them via the <strong>R</strong> class mentioned above).&#160; This folder is useful for things you might not need to localize or alter for different resolutions such as font files.&#160; You probably won’t end up using this folder very much.</p>  <p><strong>bin</strong>-This should be <em>old hat </em>for anyone that has done a lot of development.&#160; The bin folder contains the compiled application files.&#160; In general, you can ignore this folder.</p>  <p><strong>res</strong>-This folder is incredibly important.&#160; However, there aren’t any files actually in it.&#160; Instead it is split up into sub-folders.</p>  <p><strong>drawable-*</strong>-Contain graphical resources (jpegs, pngs, etc) for devices with the specific resolution.&#160; For example, if your device is HDPI, the application will automatically use the HDPI resources.&#160; You’ll find some applications that have many more <strong>drawable</strong> folders to specify landscape vs. portrait or for non-image graphical resources.&#160; When I say “non-image graphical resources” I’m referring to xml files that describe graphical resources such as an xml file that might describe the appearance of a button.&#160; In addition, Android is smart enough to find a graphical resource if it isn’t in the devices specific folder.&#160; For example, if you have a header.jpg file that’s only in the <strong>drawable-mdpi </strong>folder, Android will use that file even if the device is HDPI or LDPI.</p>  <p><strong>anim</strong>-While not present in this project, an anim folder will contain xml descriptions of animations.&#160; </p>  <p><strong>layout</strong>-This is another folder that can actually be broken down into many other folders.&#160; On the surface, layout contains xml descriptors of views.&#160; You’ve already worked with two different layouts so you should have some idea what they are for.&#160; In addition to the plane <strong>layout</strong> folder, you can have layout-land and layout-port for orientation specific layouts.&#160; Also, you can have size specific ones such as layout-large-land or layout-xlarge-port.&#160; One thing worth pointing out is that as of Android 3.2, there are new selectors for the layout folders.&#160; Now <strong>res/layout/main_activity.xml</strong> would correspond to phones, <strong>res/layout-sw600dp/main_activity.xml</strong> would be used for tablets.&#160; You can <a title="Android 3.2 Layout Size Selectors" href="http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2011/07/new-tools-for-managing-screen-sizes.html">read more about the new selectors for layouts on the Android developer blog</a>.</p>  <p><strong>menu</strong>-The menu folder contains xml descriptors of menus.&#160; You’ve already created one as an options menu.</p>  <p><strong>values</strong>-This folder contains xml files with key value pairs essentially.&#160; You’ve already seen the <strong>strings.xml </strong>file which contains a string keys and values.&#160; In addition to the <strong>strings </strong>file, you can create <strong>colors</strong>, <strong>styles</strong>, <strong>integers</strong>, and more.&#160; </p>
