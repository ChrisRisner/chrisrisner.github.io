<p align="left"><a onclick="return hs.expand(this)" class="highslide" href="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/ChrisJobs.jpg"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 10px 15px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="Chris Jobs" border="0" alt="Chris Jobs" align="right" src="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/ChrisJobs.jpg" width="244" height="202" /></a> Recently at work I had the opportunity to transfer over to working on primarily mobile related technologies.&#160; Specifically right now, we’re currently working on a iPhone application.&#160; In order to develop for the iPhone you have to use an Apple computer (i.e. you can’t develop on a windows computer).&#160; So, work had to give me a Macbook Pro.&#160; In addition to that, sooner or later I’ll get an iPhone in order to test on.&#160; Add all of that to the fact that I “won” the use of an iPad from work a couple months back, and I will very shortly have 4 iDevices (if you want to count the Macbook) in my house.&#160; In short, I’m, at least to some degree, walking away from .Net, Windows, and Microsoft.&#160; Treason, thy name is Chris.</p>
