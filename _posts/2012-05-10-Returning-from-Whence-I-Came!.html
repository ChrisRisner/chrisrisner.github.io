<p><img style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; display: inline; float: right" title="Windows Azure" alt="Windows Azure" align="right" src="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/windowsazurevertical.jpg" width="253" height="109" />It’s kind of funny that just over a year ago <a title="Committing Treason against Microsoft" href="http://chrisrisner.com/Committing-Treason-against-Microsoft">I wrote about switching my focus from Microsoft related technologies to mobile and more specifically, iOS development</a>.&#160; Since then I switched down to doing a lot more <a title="31 Days of Android" href="http://chrisrisner.com/31-Days-of-Android">Android</a> and a little less iOS.&#160; As luck would have it, this ended up leading to a pretty great opportunity.&#160; About a month ago I took a new position with a company you may have heard of in passing:&#160; <a title="Microsoft" href="http://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft</a>.&#160; Specifically I am a Technical Evangelist for Windows Azure.&#160; </p>  <p>“Woah, woah, woah, Chris! I thought you were doing iOS and Android development?”</p>  <p>I will still be doing mobile development.&#160; I’ll just be focusing more on how to connect Android and iOS applications to the Windows Azure platform.&#160; There are a mess of options out there for back ends when it comes to mobile applications.&#160; Obviously when it comes to “the Cloud”, Azure is a big player.&#160; The platform is scalable, constantly being improved, and is just at the beginning of what it’s capable of.&#160; I see nothing but opportunity when it comes to Azure and working with iOS and Android developers.&#160; </p>  <p>I will truly miss working with my former teammates, but I’m very excited about the opportunities I’ll have with Microsoft.&#160; Erin and I (and <a title="Riley!" href="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/Riley.jpg">Riley</a>) are very excited about moving out to Washington in a few months and experiencing a whole new place for all of us.&#160; </p>  <p>I look forward to expanding the focus of this site and opening it up to new topics that I haven’t covered before while continuing to talk about and discuss everything great (and not so great) about mobile!</p>  <p><font size="1">Just a reminder, everything I say on this site is my opinion and in no way that of my employer.&#160; Unless they agree with me.</font></p>
