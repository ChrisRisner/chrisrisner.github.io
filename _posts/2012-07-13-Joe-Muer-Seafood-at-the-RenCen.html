<p><img style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; display: inline; float: right" align="right" src="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/joe-muer-seafood-logo.gif" />With only a bit more than a month to go until we move to Washington, Erin and I have been trying to get in all of the things we’ve wanted to do in Michigan and haven’t had a chance to yet.&#160; Sadly some of the things, like a trip to Mackinaw Island, just won’t happen.&#160; Fortunately, we have been able to knock out a few of them, including a trip to Joe Muer Seafood at the Renaissance Center in downtown Detroit.&#160; </p>  <p>If you aren’t aware, and I wasn’t, Joe Muer Seafood was a restaurant in downtown Detroit that opened (as Joe Muer’s Oyster Bar) in 1929.&#160; The original restaurant shut down in 1989 and the Joe Muer’s grill closed in 2004.&#160; Joe Vicari, of <a title="Andiamo Restaurants" href="http://www.andiamoitalia.com/">Andriomo restaurants</a> fame, bought the rights to the name and logo from Muer and reopened Joe Muer Seafood in 2011.&#160; As Erin and I are both seafood lovers, we really wanted to try this place out before leaving town.&#160; I was travelling for work for two weeks in a row with only a brief stop at home during the weekend in between and felt it would be a good time to try it out.</p>  <p><strong></strong></p>  <p><strong>The Food</strong></p>  <p>We started with a Joe Muer sushi roll and the crab balls.&#160; The Joe Muer roll has salmon, shrimp, avocado, cucumber, crab, campyo, tuna, spicy mayo, and tempura crunch flakes.&#160; This was actually one of the best rolls of sushi we’ve had in Michigan.&#160; we had another chance to go back, I would consider just getting sushi based off the quality of this roll.&#160; The crab balls were made with blue crab and came with a stone ground mustard sauce.&#160; The balls were so-so and were kind of dry, even with the mustard sauce.&#160; I would pass on the balls in the future.</p>  <p>For our entrees, Erin had the Blue Crab Stuffed Shrimp and I had the Spice Crust Ahi Tuna.&#160; Both of our entrees were amazingly delicious.&#160; My tuna steak was the best looking, and tasting, piece of tuna I’ve had outside of Hawaii (which is coincidentally where the tuna I had at Joe Muer was from).&#160; Erin’s stuffed shrimp was nearly as good as my tuna.&#160; Her dish did come with a corn timbale which just seemed kind of weird and didn’t have a good taste to it.</p>  <p>For dessert, we were compelled to try the specialty:&#160; the Coconut Cream Cake.&#160; I don’t frequently get dessert, but cake was incredibly good.&#160; It was creamy.&#160; It was coconutty.&#160; It was good.&#160; If you go and are in the mood for a dessert, I would recommend it.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p><strong>The Drinks</strong></p>  <p><img style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; display: inline; float: right" align="right" src="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/crabby-mary.jpg" />I’ve been on a bit of a Bloody Mary kick as of late so when I saw that they had a custom one called the “Crabby Mary” I had to try it.&#160; It was exceptionally good with just the right amount of spice to it.&#160; Unfortunately, the glass they bring it in and the straws placed in it don’t really make a lot of sense. The glass they make the Crabby Mary in is quite tall, awkwardly so.&#160; The straws placed in it are perhaps two-thirds of the size of the glass.&#160; As you can see in the high-quality drawing I’ve made, this doesn’t work very well.&#160; As soon as you’ve had a drink or two, you’re left with straws you can’t reach unless you feel&#160; like going diving into the glass.&#160; That being said, it was a very good drink.&#160; Erin wanted to get a glass of Rosé and they just happened to have one Rosé on the menu by the glass.&#160; Unfortunately they were out.&#160; Erin was fine with this and got something else, however, I think that if you run out of a bottle you offer by the glass and you have others of the same kind (and they did have other Rosés), you should offer one of those by the glass.&#160; </p>  <p><strong></strong></p>  <p><strong>The Service</strong></p>  <p>When we first sat down, it was a good deal of time before our waitress came over.&#160; After she took our initial drink order, it was again a good while before she returned.&#160; Outside of that, and the wine issue mentioned above, the service was impeccable.&#160; Joe Muer Seafood is a classy place and definitely tries to present it self as such when it comes to the service as the uniform for the wait-staff includes formal white jackets.&#160; </p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p><strong>The Price</strong></p>  <p>This is a higher end restaurant so it’s going to cost more than your local Applebees.&#160; Expect to pay ten to twenty for an appetizer or sushi roll or cocktail, about ten for a low end glass of wine, and in the area of twenty-five to fifty for an entrée (with something like surf and turf closer to seventy).&#160; Overall, for the quality of the food and the level of service, the prices line up and don’t leave you wondering how you spent your money.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p><strong>Overall</strong></p>  <p>We really enjoyed the food, and the view of the river, at Joe Muer Seafood.&#160; If we were going to be in Michigan longer, we would go back, though either just for sushi, or only on a special occasion.&#160; If someone asks me where to go for a great Ahi tuna steak in the Detroit area, this is where I would tell them to go.</p>
