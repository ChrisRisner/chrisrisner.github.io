<item><title>re: Ineffective Atomic and His Ineffective Gnome Cam</title><link>http://chrisrisner.com/Ineffective-Atomic-and-His-Ineffective-Gnome-Cam</link><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;My "friendly" neighbor &lt;a href="http://atomicinternet.homeip.net/"&gt;Atomic&lt;/a&gt; has what he calls a &lt;a href="http://atomicinternet.homeip.net/webcam/"&gt;gnome cam&lt;/a&gt;.&#160; It's quite simply an all weather web cam that sits outside his front door snapping pictures every few minutes.&#160; On occasion the camera catches something interesting (see below) but usually the camera only captures images of a boring driveway.&#160; Now the problem with the gnome cam is that, while pointed directly at my house, it fails to get any helpful images of my house.&#160; If Atomic's camera was better, we could see both of our boring driveways and the count of interesting occurrences would at least double.&#160; When I moved back into my cave, he didn't exactly say he was going to get a newer and better camera, but I'm pretty sure he thought it to himself.&#160; So in response to his &lt;a href="http://atomicinternet.homeip.net/news.asp?startat=article&amp;article=1005"&gt;assurance that I'm a lazy Morlock that doesn't eat enough Eloi&lt;/a&gt;, I say, when you have a camera that allows me to more easily see the Eloi as they travel around the cave's entrance, I'll chow down.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a onclick="return hs.expand(this)" class="highslide" href="http://chrisrisner.com/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/IneffectiveAtomicandHisIneffectiveGnomeC_C702/image_4.png"&gt;&lt;img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://chrisrisner.com/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/IneffectiveAtomicandHisIneffectiveGnomeC_C702/image_thumb_1.png" width="244" height="186" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><dsq:thread_identifier>Ineffective-Atomic-and-His-Ineffective-Gnome-Cam</dsq:thread_identifier><wp:post_date_gmt>2009-09-03 01:08:00.000</wp:post_date_gmt><wp:comment_status>open</wp:comment_status><wp:comment><dsq:remote><dsq:id>18</dsq:id><dsq:avatar/></dsq:remote><wp:comment_id>45</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Stavos</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>stavos@gmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://www.detroitarchive.com</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>165.215.94.12</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2009-09-24 12:49:38.463</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content>That is some of the finest photoshop work i've seen in awhile.

While seating another group one of the servers actually showed them a hidden vault hidden behind one of the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Whitney_House" target="_blank"&gt;very old house's&lt;/a&gt; walls.&#160; So while the Whitney was good, I wish we'd had a chance to try some of the other restaurants and look forward to Restaurant Week 2010.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><dsq:thread_identifier>Detroit-Restaurant-Week-2009---The-Whitney</dsq:thread_identifier><wp:post_date_gmt>2009-09-24 02:40:00.000</wp:post_date_gmt><wp:comment_status>open</wp:comment_status><wp:comment><dsq:remote><dsq:id>10</dsq:id><dsq:avatar/></dsq:remote><wp:comment_id>46</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Chris</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>chris.risner@gmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://chrisrisner.com</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>12.165.188.130</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2009-09-25 08:48:55.103</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content>It's dark meat and it's either midget eloi or small portions of eloi.</wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment></item>

Web slices allow you to designate a portion of your site that a viewer can "subscribe too".&#160; This is similar to the very common rss feed, however, the idea with a web slice is that you can access and view it directly from your browser's favorite bar.&#160;&#160; From there you can hover over the site and see the most current content in that web slice.&#160; So if there is a particular site you read often, you can quickly hover over to see if there is something new to check out.&#160; As far as I know, as of now, only IE8 supports web slices.&#160; However, according to wikipedia, Microsoft has "donated the specification to the public domain."&#160; While this might work out well for one or two sites, I can't image anyone that reads a lot of sites adding that many web slices to their browser.&#160; (re:&#160; It's kind of cool, but I don't see it getting a ton of use).&#160; So if you have your own site and you'd like to add a web slice to it, how do you do it?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;First you could just go &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2009/03/03/create-a-dynamic-web-slice-in-5-minutes.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&#160; This seems to give a pretty good explanation on how to set up your web slice.&#160; However, if that site is down (as it was for maintenance at the time of writing this), you can also do this.&#160; Around the content you want to put in your slice (i.e. your most recent blog entry), you'll put the following:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class="csharpcode"&gt;   &lt;div class="csharpcode"&gt;     &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   1:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="html"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="attr"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;='hslice entry-content'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="attr"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;='blogInfo'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/pre&gt;        &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   2:  &lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="attr"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;='width: 100%; background-color: #ffffff;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;        &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   3:  &lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="html"&gt;span&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="attr"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;='entry-title'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="attr"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;='display: none;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Title&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="html"&gt;span&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

         &lt;/pre&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;style type="text/css"&gt;  .csharpcode, .csharpcode pre  {   font-size: small;   color: black;   font-family: consolas, "Courier New", courier, monospace;

}&lt;/style&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;So what's important here?&#160; Well the first div specifies that this is your slice.&#160; The style on that div is used for actually displaying your content when the user clicks on the slice in their favorites bar.&#160; The span line is used to specify what the default title of the web slice.&#160; So in the image above, my slice is "Chris Risner . Com" so that's what I would have where "Title" is shown in the example.&#160; Finally the content area is where you put whatever you want to show.&#160; The page linked above shows how to link to a different page for your slice content which I won't show but you can mess around with yourself.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;One final comment on web slices has to do with the Favicon that shows up with your slice.&#160; When I first added mine, it was showing up with the default IE icon.&#160; After seeing this I realized that IE wasn't actually showing up with my favicon at all.&#160; However, my favicon, which I had just placed in the root directory of my site was showing up with both Chrome and Firefox.&#160; After looking around for a while, I realized that while those two browsers were content with just looking for my favicon in the default location, IE needed more instruction.&#160; If this happens to you, add an explicit shortcut icon link in your header html like so:&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;div class="csharpcode"&gt;    &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   1:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="html"&gt;link&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="attr"&gt;rel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;=&quot;SHORTCUT ICON&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="attr"&gt;href&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;=&quot;http://mysite/favicon.ico&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;style type="text/css"&gt;    .csharpcode, .csharpcode pre  {   font-size: small;   color: black;   font-family: consolas, "Courier New", courier, monospace;   background-color: #ffffff;   /*white-space: pre;*/  }  .csharpcode pre { margin: 0em; }  .csharpcode .rem { color: #008000; }  .csharpcode .kwrd { color: #0000ff; }  .csharpcode .str { color: #006080; }  .csharpcode .op { color: #0000c0; }  .csharpcode .preproc { color: #cc6633; }  .csharpcode .asp { background-color: #ffff00; }  .csharpcode .html { color: #800000; }  .csharpcode .attr { color: #ff0000; }  .csharpcode .alt   {   background-color: #f4f4f4;   width: 100%;   margin: 0em;  }  .csharpcode .lnum { color: #606060; }&lt;/style&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  Happy slicing.     </content:encoded><dsq:thread_identifier>Adding-a-Web-Slice-to-your-Site</dsq:thread_identifier><wp:post_date_gmt>2009-10-10 01:58:00.000</wp:post_date_gmt><wp:comment_status>open</wp:comment_status><wp:comment><dsq:remote><dsq:id>18</dsq:id><dsq:avatar/></dsq:remote><wp:comment_id>47</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Stavos</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>stavos@gmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://www.detroitarchive.com</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>65.29.123.145</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2009-10-12 09:30:22.287</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content>Now I can have a little slice of Risner before breakfast! </wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment></item>

Com" so that's what I would have where "Title" is shown in the example.&#160; Finally the content area is where you put whatever you want to show.&#160; The page linked above shows how to link to a different page for your slice content which I won't show but you can mess around with yourself.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;One final comment on web slices has to do with the Favicon that shows up with your slice.&#160; When I first added mine, it was showing up with the default IE icon.&#160; After seeing this I realized that IE wasn't actually showing up with my favicon at all.&#160; However, my favicon, which I had just placed in the root directory of my site was showing up with both Chrome and Firefox.&#160; After looking around for a while, I realized that while those two browsers were content with just looking for my favicon in the default location, IE needed more instruction.&#160; If this happens to you, add an explicit shortcut icon link in your header html like so:&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;div class="csharpcode"&gt;    &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   1:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="html"&gt;link&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="attr"&gt;rel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;=&quot;SHORTCUT ICON&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="attr"&gt;href&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;=&quot;http://mysite/favicon.ico&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;style type="text/css"&gt;    .csharpcode, .csharpcode pre  {   font-size: small;   color: black;   font-family: consolas, "Courier New", courier, monospace;   background-color: #ffffff;   /*white-space: pre;*/  }  .csharpcode pre { margin: 0em; }  .csharpcode .rem { color: #008000; }  .csharpcode .kwrd { color: #0000ff; }  .csharpcode .str { color: #006080; }  .csharpcode .op { color: #0000c0; }  .csharpcode .preproc { color: #cc6633; }  .csharpcode .asp { background-color: #ffff00; }  .csharpcode .html { color: #800000; }  .csharpcode .attr { color: #ff0000; }  .csharpcode .alt   {   background-color: #f4f4f4;   width: 100%;   margin: 0em;  }  .csharpcode .lnum { color: #606060; }&lt;/style&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  Happy slicing.     </content:encoded><dsq:thread_identifier>Adding-a-Web-Slice-to-your-Site</dsq:thread_identifier><wp:post_date_gmt>2009-10-10 01:58:00.000</wp:post_date_gmt><wp:comment_status>open</wp:comment_status><wp:comment><dsq:remote><dsq:id>10</dsq:id><dsq:avatar/></dsq:remote><wp:comment_id>48</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Chris</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>chris.risner@gmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://chrisrisner.com</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>12.165.188.130</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2009-10-12 09:45:14.683</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content>It's like a dream come true isn't it?</wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment></item>

display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; margin-left: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; margin-right: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" align="right" src="http://chrisrisner.com/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/AddingaWebSlicetoyourSite_131E1/image_thumb_1.png" width="244" height="129" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;With the release of IE8, Microsoft introduced the concept of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer_8" target="_blank"&gt;Web Slices (scroll down a bit)&lt;/a&gt;.&#160; Web slices allow you to designate a portion of your site that a viewer can "subscribe too".&#160; This is similar to the very common rss feed, however, the idea with a web slice is that you can access and view it directly from your browser's favorite bar.&#160;&#160; From there you can hover over the site and see the most current content in that web slice.&#160; So if there is a particular site you read often, you can quickly hover over to see if there is something new to check out.&#160; As far as I know, as of now, only IE8 supports web slices.&#160; However, according to wikipedia, Microsoft has "donated the specification to the public domain."&#160; While this might work out well for one or two sites, I can't image anyone that reads a lot of sites adding that many web slices to their browser.&#160; (re:&#160; It's kind of cool, but I don't see it getting a ton of use).&#160; So if you have your own site and you'd like to add a web slice to it, how do you do it?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;First you could just go &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2009/03/03/create-a-dynamic-web-slice-in-5-minutes.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&#160; This seems to give a pretty good explanation on how to set up your web slice.&#160; However, if that site is down (as it was for maintenance at the time of writing this), you can also do this.&#160; Around the content you want to put in your slice (i.e. your most recent blog entry), you'll put the following:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class="csharpcode"&gt;   &lt;div class="csharpcode"&gt;     &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   1:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="html"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="attr"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;='hslice entry-content'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="attr"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;='blogInfo'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/pre&gt;        &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   2:  &lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="attr"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;='width: 100%; background-color: #ffffff;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;        &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   3:  &lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="html"&gt;span&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="attr"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;='entry-title'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="attr"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;='display: none;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Title&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="html"&gt;span&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;        &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   4:  &lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="rem"&gt;&lt;!-- Content --&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;        &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   5:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="html"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

<item><title>re: The Pumpkin Drop</title><link>http://chrisrisner.com/The-Pumpkin-Drop</link><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As a team building event at work, we did an Egg Drop.&#160; The idea was that each team would build some contraption to carry an egg safely down from a 4 story drop.&#160; My team at work decided that it would be pretty cool, and seasonably awesome, to put the egg in a pumpkin.&#160; So mid-way through October, we picked up three pumpkins from a local greenhouse, dug them out, filled them with popcorn (it's a shock absorber), and placed our egg in it.&#160; As a test, we threw the pumpkins off the highest point we could find while it still being safe to drink beer: my roof.&#160; You can see in the below video that we were able to successfully drop the pumpkins off the roof without the egg breaking.&#160; Unfortunately when we made our &lt;a href="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/pump2.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;final egg dropping device&lt;/a&gt; it just didn't end up &lt;a href="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/pump1.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;protecting our egg&lt;/a&gt;.&#160; So while you can't be happy knowing our death star protected it's precious cargo, you can be happy to know that I don't mind throwing pumpkins off of my roof:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div style="padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px auto; padding-left: 0px; width: 425px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; padding-top: 0px" id="scid:5737277B-5D6D-4f48-ABFC-DD9C333F4C5D:62164e53-a698-48f1-a0f4-0dbeb29ad01a" class="wlWriterEditableSmartContent"&gt;&lt;div id="fd9b976f-5f29-4ee5-811b-05ab2d4524b3" style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; display: inline;"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x0t2oXSHiA&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" target="_new"&gt;&lt;img src="http://chrisrisner.com/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/ThePumpkinDrop_12063/video66db32500562.jpg" style="border-style: none" galleryimg="no" onload="var downlevelDiv = document.getElementById('fd9b976f-5f29-4ee5-811b-05ab2d4524b3'); downlevelDiv.innerHTML = &quot;&lt;div&gt;&lt;object width=\&quot;425\&quot; height=\&quot;355\&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=\&quot;movie\&quot; value=\&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/_x0t2oXSHiA&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;&amp;hl=en\&quot;&gt;&lt;\/param&gt;&lt;embed src=\&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/_x0t2oXSHiA&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;&amp;hl=en\&quot; type=\&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash\&quot; width=\&quot;425\&quot; height=\&quot;355\&quot;&gt;&lt;\/embed&gt;&lt;\/object&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&quot;;" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded><dsq:thread_identifier>The-Pumpkin-Drop</dsq:thread_identifier><wp:post_date_gmt>2009-11-17 01:31:00.000</wp:post_date_gmt><wp:comment_status>open</wp:comment_status><wp:comment><dsq:remote><dsq:id>12</dsq:id><dsq:avatar/></dsq:remote><wp:comment_id>68</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>AtomicInternet</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>atomicinternet@gmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://atomicinternet.homeip.net</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>12.165.188.130</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2009-11-23 16:30:24.330</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content>I was there!</wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment></item>

While most of the blame really falls on Microsoft, I feel it's critical that &lt;a href="http://atomicinternet.homeip.net/"&gt;AtomicInternet&lt;/a&gt; understand his role in bringing the SEO Toolkit to it's knees.

One of the coolest things about the ASP .Net MVC framework is how it allows you to extensively control URL routing.&#160; Currently this is a huge benefit over web forms (though Web Forms will be &lt;a title="Web Forms in 4.0" href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2009/10/13/url-routing-with-asp-net-4-web-forms-vs-2010-and-net-4-0-series.aspx"&gt;capable of this too with .net 4.0&lt;/a&gt;).&#160; I won't get to deep into what URL Routing is but for the sake of this article, URL Routing is a way to expose SEO friendly and "good looking" URLs that don't necessarily map to a physical file but don't require the use of parameters to get to your content.&#160; An example of this can be found on this site.&#160; The url of the last entry is this:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a title="http://chrisrisner.com/Windows-7-IIS-7-5-Site-Failure" href="http://chrisrisner.com/Blog/Archive/Windows-7-IIS-7-5-Site-Failure"&gt;http://chrisrisner.com/Blog/Archive/Windows-7-IIS-7-5-Site-Failure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;However, prior to URL routing, we'd probably have something like this:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://chrisrisner.com/Blog/Entry?Title=Windows-IIS-7-5-Site-Failure"&gt;http://chrisrisner.com/Blog/Entry?Title=Windows-IIS-7-5-Site-Failure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

One of the coolest things about the ASP .Net MVC framework is how it allows you to extensively control URL routing.&#160; Currently this is a huge benefit over web forms (though Web Forms will be &lt;a title="Web Forms in 4.0" href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2009/10/13/url-routing-with-asp-net-4-web-forms-vs-2010-and-net-4-0-series.aspx"&gt;capable of this too with .net 4.0&lt;/a&gt;).&#160; I won't get to deep into what URL Routing is but for the sake of this article, URL Routing is a way to expose SEO friendly and "good looking" URLs that don't necessarily map to a physical file but don't require the use of parameters to get to your content.&#160; An example of this can be found on this site.&#160; The url of the last entry is this:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a title="http://chrisrisner.com/Windows-7-IIS-7-5-Site-Failure" href="http://chrisrisner.com/Blog/Archive/Windows-7-IIS-7-5-Site-Failure"&gt;http://chrisrisner.com/Blog/Archive/Windows-7-IIS-7-5-Site-Failure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;However, prior to URL routing, we'd probably have something like this:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://chrisrisner.com/Blog/Entry?Title=Windows-IIS-7-5-Site-Failure"&gt;http://chrisrisner.com/Blog/Entry?Title=Windows-IIS-7-5-Site-Failure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It's not horrible but it's not the best thing for SEO.&#160; However, one part of making a link as SEO friendly as possible is using as few directories as possible.&#160; So instead of having /Blog/Archive/EntryTitle, I'd rather just have &lt;a href="http://chrisrisner.com/EntryTitle"&gt;http://chrisrisner.com/EntryTitle&lt;/a&gt;.&#160;

This happens when the section is locked at a parent level.

margin: 0px 0px 5px 10px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="ASP .Net MVC" border="0" alt="ASP .Net MVC" align="right" src="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/633990090370163974.jpg" width="159" height="74" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; One of the coolest things about the ASP .Net MVC framework is how it allows you to extensively control URL routing.&#160; Currently this is a huge benefit over web forms (though Web Forms will be &lt;a title="Web Forms in 4.0" href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2009/10/13/url-routing-with-asp-net-4-web-forms-vs-2010-and-net-4-0-series.aspx"&gt;capable of this too with .net 4.0&lt;/a&gt;).&#160; I won't get to deep into what URL Routing is but for the sake of this article, URL Routing is a way to expose SEO friendly and "good looking" URLs that don't necessarily map to a physical file but don't require the use of parameters to get to your content.&#160; An example of this can be found on this site.&#160; The url of the last entry is this:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a title="http://chrisrisner.com/Windows-7-IIS-7-5-Site-Failure" href="http://chrisrisner.com/Blog/Archive/Windows-7-IIS-7-5-Site-Failure"&gt;http://chrisrisner.com/Blog/Archive/Windows-7-IIS-7-5-Site-Failure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;However, prior to URL routing, we'd probably have something like this:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://chrisrisner.com/Blog/Entry?Title=Windows-IIS-7-5-Site-Failure"&gt;http://chrisrisner.com/Blog/Entry?Title=Windows-IIS-7-5-Site-Failure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It's not horrible but it's not the best thing for SEO.&#160; However, one part of making a link as SEO friendly as possible is using as few directories as possible.&#160; So instead of having /Blog/Archive/EntryTitle, I'd rather just have &lt;a href="http://chrisrisner.com/EntryTitle"&gt;http://chrisrisner.com/EntryTitle&lt;/a&gt;.&#160; Thankfully, URL Routing allows for this.&#160;&#160; Let's say in my route registrar, I have the following:    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class="csharpcode"&gt;   &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   1:  &lt;/span&gt;routes.MapRoute(&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   2:  &lt;/span&gt;                &lt;span class="str"&gt;&quot;Blog&quot;&lt;/span&gt;,                                              &lt;span class="rem"&gt;// Route name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   3:  &lt;/span&gt;                &lt;span class="str"&gt;&quot;Blog/{action}/{id}&quot;&lt;/span&gt;,                           &lt;span class="rem"&gt;// URL with parameters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   4:  &lt;/span&gt;                &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; { controller = &lt;span class="str"&gt;&quot;Blog&quot;&lt;/span&gt;, action = &lt;span class="str"&gt;&quot;Index&quot;&lt;/span&gt;, id = &lt;span class="str"&gt;&quot;&quot;&lt;/span&gt; }  &lt;span class="rem"&gt;// Parameter defaults&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   5:  &lt;/span&gt;            );&lt;/pre&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;style type="text/css"&gt;  .csharpcode, .csharpcode pre  {   font-size: small;   color: black;   font-family: consolas, "Courier New", courier, monospace;   background-color: #ffffff;   /*white-space: pre;*/  }  .csharpcode pre { margin: 0em; }  .csharpcode .rem { color: #008000; }  .csharpcode .kwrd { color: #0000ff; }  .csharpcode .str { color: #006080; }  .csharpcode .op { color: #0000c0; }  .csharpcode .preproc { color: #cc6633; }  .csharpcode .asp { background-color: #ffff00; }  .csharpcode .html { color: #800000; }  .csharpcode .attr { color: #ff0000; }  .csharpcode .alt   {   background-color: #f4f4f4;   width: 100%;   margin: 0em;  }  .csharpcode .lnum { color: #606060; }&lt;/style&gt;    &lt;p&gt;This would allow the easy /Blog/Archive/EntryTitle links.&#160; I could then follow that up with this to allow the even more friendly chrisrisner.com/EntryTitle links:&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;div class="csharpcode"&gt;    &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   1:  &lt;/span&gt;routes.MapRoute(&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   2:  &lt;/span&gt;                &lt;span class="str"&gt;&quot;BlogEntry&quot;&lt;/span&gt;,                                              &lt;span class="rem"&gt;// Route name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   3:  &lt;/span&gt;                &lt;span class="str"&gt;&quot;{id}&quot;&lt;/span&gt;,                           &lt;span class="rem"&gt;// URL with parameters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   4:  &lt;/span&gt;                &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; { controller = &lt;span class="str"&gt;&quot;Blog&quot;&lt;/span&gt;, action = &lt;span class="str"&gt;&quot;Archive&quot;&lt;/span&gt;, id = &lt;span class="str"&gt;&quot;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

<item><title>re: How to Interview: Part 1</title><link>http://chrisrisner.com/How-to-Interview--Part-1</link><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a onclick="return hs.expand(this)" class="highslide" href="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/633999420859710928.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="border-right-width: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 10px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="Interview" border="0" alt="Interview" align="right" src="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/633999420859710928.jpg" width="244" height="243" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Interviews suck.&#160; There's no way around it.&#160; It's impossible to know exactly what your interviewers are going to expect or want.&#160; Recently I was going through my feed reader and came across &lt;a title="How to not suck at technical interviews" href="http://www.bradcunningham.net/2010/01/how-to-not-suck-at-technical-interview.html"&gt;this article about "How to not suck at a technical interview."&lt;/a&gt;&#160; Prior to reading that, I had been planning on writing something about interviewing and using that as inspiration, I decided I'd finally do it.&#160; In the past 2 years, I've interviewed about 200 to 250 people for technical positions (primarily .Net Engineers).&#160; In the past 6 months, I've been in many interviews as &lt;a href="https://www.quickenloans.com/"&gt;my current employer&lt;/a&gt; has been looking for new .Net engineers. While Brad's post, and this one, focus primarily on technical interviews, the core principles of both his article and the series I'm planning to write here can be taken and applied to any sort of interview.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&#160; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h4&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;h4&gt;1.&#160; Know your abilities and rate yourself right&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One of the first things I do on every interview is ask the person to rate themselves on a few technical categories.&#160; It's a straight 1 to 10 scale where 1 is they haven't heard of it and 10 is they could answer any question I could come up with.&#160; I never want to hear a person rate themselves a 10.&#160; More than 99% of the time, you don't know everything about a topic and you should assume that.&#160; What's worse, most people that do rate themselves a 10 can't answer most of the basic questions that I'd expect a 5 to answer.&#160; There's no way you know everything so rating yourself a 10 is only going to hurt you.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h4&gt;2.&#160; Be honest on your resume&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In today's economy, people will do just about anything to land an interview at a good company.&#160; It seems for a lot of people, that includes throwing every buzzword they can find on to their resume.&#160; When working on your resume, the rule of thumb you should follow is, if you put it on there, you should be able to answer questions about it.&#160; In detail.&#160; If you say you worked on Nhibernate on a project, I want to know how you set it up.&#160; If you've worked on both WCF and ASMX web services, I'm going to want to know the differences between them.&#160; Saying that you worked on a project where the tech lead incorporated something is not good enough.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h4&gt;3.&#160; Know your resume&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Nothing is worse than asking someone to go over their past work and project experience and having them pick up their resume and read from it line by line.&#160; If you've made it to a phone or in-person interview, I've obviously at least spent some time looking at your resume.&#160; You should know what's on it and you should know it well enough to talk about it without looking at it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h4&gt;4.&#160; Be prepared to answer questions about gaps and job hops&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If you've had 4 different jobs in the past 4 years, I am going to want to know why.&#160; Any recruiter will want to know why as well.&#160; The reason here is obvious:&#160; if you left (or were asked to leave) your last 3 jobs after less than a year, why wouldn't you do the same thing if I hire you?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h4&gt;5.&#160; Tell me if you don't know the answer to a question&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A few things can happen when I ask you a question you don't know the answer to:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ul&gt;   &lt;li&gt;You think you know and answer incorrectly &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;You don't know and you make something up and get it right (lucky but not very likely).&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;You don't know know and you make something up and get it wrong (more likely)&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;You say you don't know&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If you haven't sent any red flags up before we got to this question, I'm going to ask you how you'd find the answer.&#160; An interview is not all about finding out about the experience a person has.&#160; Especially in technology, the experience you have today might not matter tomorrow.&#160; I want to also find out how you're going to figure problems out going forward.&#160; When it comes to this, again, be honest.&#160; Would you talk to coworkers?&#160; Would you search on Google or Bing?&#160; Would you try to find a book that might have the answer?&#160; Would you post in a forum?&#160; One caveat to this is that I don't want to hear you say that every time a situation like this comes up you go talk to your friend Steve or your architect Matt.&#160; If that's your answer for everything, feel free to send Steve or Matt's resume my way.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h4&gt;6.&#160; Research the company you're interviewing at&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;p&gt;At a bare minimum, you should have some knowledge of what the company you're interview at does.&#160; Scour the internet for information on the company.&#160; Understand how their business works.&#160; As an example, if you were interviewing at US Airways for a software engineering position, try to learn about how an airline works.&#160; What sort of problems do they solve?&#160;&#160; What could they do better?&#160; Spend sometime trying to solve the &lt;a title="travelling salesman problem" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem"&gt;travelling salesman problem&lt;/a&gt;.&#160; The point is, just knowing that US Airways flies planes from points A to points B isn't enough.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h4&gt;7.&#160; Be ready to write code&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I'm sure I'll catch some flak for this one but, if you're interviewing for a programming position, I'm going to expect you to be able to write some code without an IDE.&#160; Intellisense is awesome and helps me get some things done a lot faster, however, I still know what I'm doing without it and you should too.&#160; Someone could answer all of the technical questions I could dream of and not be able to write a line of code.&#160; Bottom line: if you interview with me, you're going to have to write code.&#160; Period.&#160; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h4&gt;8.&#160; Follow up with any questions you didn't have the answer to&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One of the things I find most impressive with an interviewee is when they follow up after a phone or in-person interview with the answers to questions they missed.&#160; It demonstrates that they're paying attention and are enthusiastic about both the job and staying knowledgeable.&#160; I know it's hard to remember after a phone interview what the questions were that you missed, but it's not too hard to jot down a word at the time the question is asked so you'll remember afterwards.&#160; I can't stress how easy this is to accomplish and how impressive it seems when you do.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h4&gt;9.&#160; Be passionate about what you do&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The biggest thing I'm looking for when I interview someone is passion.&#160; If I'm trying to find a .Net Developer, I want to hear about how they play with the latest beta release to come from Microsoft.&#160; If they've done ASP .Net and PHP, I want to know all about the differences and why they like one over the other.&#160; This is incredibly hard to quantify but incredibly important if it's down to you and another person for a job.&#160; Every single time I'm going to take the person that's a bit less experienced but really passionate about what they do over the person that has more experience but comes off as just a 9-5 worker.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h4&gt;10.&#160; Ask questions about the position / team / company you're interviewing for&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When I'm done asking my questions, I always give the interviewee the chance to ask whatever questions they have.&#160; This is your chance to find out about the job you'd be doing, the team you'd be on, and the company you'd be working for.&#160; Remember that this isn't just about me interviewing you, this is about you interviewing me.&#160; You could go into an interview thinking the company you're talking to rocks only to find out that it sounds like a corporate hell hole.&#160; Asking questions like the following can help me with my perception and understanding of you and they can make sure you're applying at the right place:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ul&gt;   &lt;li&gt;How is the team structured?&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;What sort of projects would I be working on?&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;If I find something being done that I think can be improved, what would I do?&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Why do you like working here?&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Is there typically a lot of documentation surrounding projects or very little?&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;If I have questions, can I go directly to the person that has the answer or do I need to go through someone else? (I know this might sound crazy but I've worked at a company where I was actually not allowed to talk to a Database Administrator directly)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;h4&gt;11.&#160; Ask what you could have done better at the end&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Of all the interviews I've done, I've only had 5 to 10 people ask how they did at the end of the interview and how they could have done better.&#160; If the person interviewing you gives a damn (and if they don't they shouldn't be interviewing people) they should give you an honest answer.&#160; By the time you're talking to a recruiter again, the people that interviewed you have probably already forgotten why they passed on you and how you did in your interview.&#160; Sometimes you're not going to get a very detailed answer, but any feedback can help. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h4&gt;&#160;&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The biggest lesson that can be learned from all of this is to just &lt;strong&gt;be honest&lt;/strong&gt;.&#160; Overstating your skill level, lying, and blind guessing will end up hurting you in the end.&#160; Furthermore, never be afraid to ask a question of the people interviewing you.&#160; If your question is reasonable and they won't answer it, you're probably not interviewing at the right company.&#160; I'm hoping to have a few more entries in the coming weeks and months about interviewing. I'm definitely going to talk about how to be the obvious choice if you're a junior- or entry-level person as well as go over to the other side of the table and talk about how best to interview people if you're trying to fill a position.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;*Note&lt;/strong&gt;:&#160; These are my opinions and thoughts and don't reflects the opinions or thoughts of my employer, my dog, Bananarama, or anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><dsq:thread_identifier>How-to-Interview--Part-1</dsq:thread_identifier><wp:post_date_gmt>2010-01-24 22:47:00.000</wp:post_date_gmt><wp:comment_status>open</wp:comment_status><wp:comment><dsq:remote><dsq:id>12</dsq:id><dsq:avatar/></dsq:remote><wp:comment_id>106</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>AtomicInternet</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>atomicinternet@gmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://atomicinternet.homeip.net</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>98.27.70.119</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2010-01-24 20:50:31.343</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content>Drat, I respect the opinion of Bananarama above all others.</wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment></item>

(I know this might sound crazy but I've worked at a company where I was actually not allowed to talk to a Database Administrator directly)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;h4&gt;11.&#160; Ask what you could have done better at the end&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Of all the interviews I've done, I've only had 5 to 10 people ask how they did at the end of the interview and how they could have done better.&#160; If the person interviewing you gives a damn (and if they don't they shouldn't be interviewing people) they should give you an honest answer.&#160; By the time you're talking to a recruiter again, the people that interviewed you have probably already forgotten why they passed on you and how you did in your interview.&#160; Sometimes you're not going to get a very detailed answer, but any feedback can help. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h4&gt;&#160;&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The biggest lesson that can be learned from all of this is to just &lt;strong&gt;be honest&lt;/strong&gt;.&#160; Overstating your skill level, lying, and blind guessing will end up hurting you in the end.&#160; Furthermore, never be afraid to ask a question of the people interviewing you.&#160; If your question is reasonable and they won't answer it, you're probably not interviewing at the right company.&#160; I'm hoping to have a few more entries in the coming weeks and months about interviewing. I'm definitely going to talk about how to be the obvious choice if you're a junior- or entry-level person as well as go over to the other side of the table and talk about how best to interview people if you're trying to fill a position.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;*Note&lt;/strong&gt;:&#160; These are my opinions and thoughts and don't reflects the opinions or thoughts of my employer, my dog, Bananarama, or anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><dsq:thread_identifier>How-to-Interview--Part-1</dsq:thread_identifier><wp:post_date_gmt>2010-01-24 22:47:00.000</wp:post_date_gmt><wp:comment_status>open</wp:comment_status><wp:comment><dsq:remote><dsq:id>18</dsq:id><dsq:avatar/></dsq:remote><wp:comment_id>107</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Stavos</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>stavos@gmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://www.detroitarchive.com</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>65.29.123.145</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2010-01-25 18:27:33.100</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content>Great read, however I think you forgot one crucial aspect: Show willingness to grow and improve if you lack in any area's.

<item><title>re: How to Interview: Part 1</title><link>http://chrisrisner.com/How-to-Interview--Part-1</link><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a onclick="return hs.expand(this)" class="highslide" href="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/633999420859710928.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="border-right-width: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 10px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="Interview" border="0" alt="Interview" align="right" src="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/633999420859710928.jpg" width="244" height="243" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Interviews suck.&#160; There's no way around it.&#160; It's impossible to know exactly what your interviewers are going to expect or want.&#160; Recently I was going through my feed reader and came across &lt;a title="How to not suck at technical interviews" href="http://www.bradcunningham.net/2010/01/how-to-not-suck-at-technical-interview.html"&gt;this article about "How to not suck at a technical interview."&lt;/a&gt;&#160; Prior to reading that, I had been planning on writing something about interviewing and using that as inspiration, I decided I'd finally do it.&#160; In the past 2 years, I've interviewed about 200 to 250 people for technical positions (primarily .Net Engineers).&#160; In the past 6 months, I've been in many interviews as &lt;a href="https://www.quickenloans.com/"&gt;my current employer&lt;/a&gt; has been looking for new .Net engineers. While Brad's post, and this one, focus primarily on technical interviews, the core principles of both his article and the series I'm planning to write here can be taken and applied to any sort of interview.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&#160; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h4&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;h4&gt;1.&#160; Know your abilities and rate yourself right&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One of the first things I do on every interview is ask the person to rate themselves on a few technical categories.&#160; It's a straight 1 to 10 scale where 1 is they haven't heard of it and 10 is they could answer any question I could come up with.&#160; I never want to hear a person rate themselves a 10.&#160; More than 99% of the time, you don't know everything about a topic and you should assume that.&#160; What's worse, most people that do rate themselves a 10 can't answer most of the basic questions that I'd expect a 5 to answer.&#160; There's no way you know everything so rating yourself a 10 is only going to hurt you.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h4&gt;2.&#160; Be honest on your resume&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In today's economy, people will do just about anything to land an interview at a good company.&#160; It seems for a lot of people, that includes throwing every buzzword they can find on to their resume.&#160; When working on your resume, the rule of thumb you should follow is, if you put it on there, you should be able to answer questions about it.&#160; In detail.&#160; If you say you worked on Nhibernate on a project, I want to know how you set it up.&#160; If you've worked on both WCF and ASMX web services, I'm going to want to know the differences between them.&#160; Saying that you worked on a project where the tech lead incorporated something is not good enough.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h4&gt;3.&#160; Know your resume&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Nothing is worse than asking someone to go over their past work and project experience and having them pick up their resume and read from it line by line.&#160; If you've made it to a phone or in-person interview, I've obviously at least spent some time looking at your resume.&#160; You should know what's on it and you should know it well enough to talk about it without looking at it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h4&gt;4.&#160; Be prepared to answer questions about gaps and job hops&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If you've had 4 different jobs in the past 4 years, I am going to want to know why.&#160; Any recruiter will want to know why as well.&#160; The reason here is obvious:&#160; if you left (or were asked to leave) your last 3 jobs after less than a year, why wouldn't you do the same thing if I hire you?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h4&gt;5.&#160; Tell me if you don't know the answer to a question&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A few things can happen when I ask you a question you don't know the answer to:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ul&gt;   &lt;li&gt;You think you know and answer incorrectly &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;You don't know and you make something up and get it right (lucky but not very likely).&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;You don't know know and you make something up and get it wrong (more likely)&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;You say you don't know&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If you haven't sent any red flags up before we got to this question, I'm going to ask you how you'd find the answer.&#160; An interview is not all about finding out about the experience a person has.&#160; Especially in technology, the experience you have today might not matter tomorrow.&#160; I want to also find out how you're going to figure problems out going forward.&#160; When it comes to this, again, be honest.&#160; Would you talk to coworkers?&#160; Would you search on Google or Bing?&#160; Would you try to find a book that might have the answer?&#160; Would you post in a forum?&#160; One caveat to this is that I don't want to hear you say that every time a situation like this comes up you go talk to your friend Steve or your architect Matt.&#160; If that's your answer for everything, feel free to send Steve or Matt's resume my way.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h4&gt;6.&#160; Research the company you're interviewing at&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;p&gt;At a bare minimum, you should have some knowledge of what the company you're interview at does.&#160; Scour the internet for information on the company.&#160; Understand how their business works.&#160; As an example, if you were interviewing at US Airways for a software engineering position, try to learn about how an airline works.&#160; What sort of problems do they solve?&#160;&#160; What could they do better?&#160; Spend sometime trying to solve the &lt;a title="travelling salesman problem" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem"&gt;travelling salesman problem&lt;/a&gt;.&#160; The point is, just knowing that US Airways flies planes from points A to points B isn't enough.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h4&gt;7.&#160; Be ready to write code&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I'm sure I'll catch some flak for this one but, if you're interviewing for a programming position, I'm going to expect you to be able to write some code without an IDE.&#160; Intellisense is awesome and helps me get some things done a lot faster, however, I still know what I'm doing without it and you should too.&#160; Someone could answer all of the technical questions I could dream of and not be able to write a line of code.&#160; Bottom line: if you interview with me, you're going to have to write code.&#160; Period.&#160; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h4&gt;8.&#160; Follow up with any questions you didn't have the answer to&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One of the things I find most impressive with an interviewee is when they follow up after a phone or in-person interview with the answers to questions they missed.&#160; It demonstrates that they're paying attention and are enthusiastic about both the job and staying knowledgeable.&#160; I know it's hard to remember after a phone interview what the questions were that you missed, but it's not too hard to jot down a word at the time the question is asked so you'll remember afterwards.&#160; I can't stress how easy this is to accomplish and how impressive it seems when you do.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h4&gt;9.&#160; Be passionate about what you do&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The biggest thing I'm looking for when I interview someone is passion.&#160; If I'm trying to find a .Net Developer, I want to hear about how they play with the latest beta release to come from Microsoft.&#160; If they've done ASP .Net and PHP, I want to know all about the differences and why they like one over the other.&#160; This is incredibly hard to quantify but incredibly important if it's down to you and another person for a job.&#160; Every single time I'm going to take the person that's a bit less experienced but really passionate about what they do over the person that has more experience but comes off as just a 9-5 worker.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h4&gt;10.&#160; Ask questions about the position / team / company you're interviewing for&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When I'm done asking my questions, I always give the interviewee the chance to ask whatever questions they have.&#160; This is your chance to find out about the job you'd be doing, the team you'd be on, and the company you'd be working for.&#160; Remember that this isn't just about me interviewing you, this is about you interviewing me.&#160; You could go into an interview thinking the company you're talking to rocks only to find out that it sounds like a corporate hell hole.&#160; Asking questions like the following can help me with my perception and understanding of you and they can make sure you're applying at the right place:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ul&gt;   &lt;li&gt;How is the team structured?&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;What sort of projects would I be working on?&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;If I find something being done that I think can be improved, what would I do?&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Why do you like working here?&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Is there typically a lot of documentation surrounding projects or very little?&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;If I have questions, can I go directly to the person that has the answer or do I need to go through someone else? (I know this might sound crazy but I've worked at a company where I was actually not allowed to talk to a Database Administrator directly)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;h4&gt;11.&#160; Ask what you could have done better at the end&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Of all the interviews I've done, I've only had 5 to 10 people ask how they did at the end of the interview and how they could have done better.&#160; If the person interviewing you gives a damn (and if they don't they shouldn't be interviewing people) they should give you an honest answer.&#160; By the time you're talking to a recruiter again, the people that interviewed you have probably already forgotten why they passed on you and how you did in your interview.&#160; Sometimes you're not going to get a very detailed answer, but any feedback can help. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h4&gt;&#160;&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The biggest lesson that can be learned from all of this is to just &lt;strong&gt;be honest&lt;/strong&gt;.&#160; Overstating your skill level, lying, and blind guessing will end up hurting you in the end.&#160; Furthermore, never be afraid to ask a question of the people interviewing you.&#160; If your question is reasonable and they won't answer it, you're probably not interviewing at the right company.&#160; I'm hoping to have a few more entries in the coming weeks and months about interviewing.

<item><title>re: GoDaddy and the Mysterious Case of Spammed Email</title><link>http://chrisrisner.com/GoDaddy-and-the-Mysterious-Case-of-Spammed-Email</link><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a onclick="return hs.expand(this)" class="highslide" href="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/634018601615978553.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="border-right-width: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 10px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="GoDaddy" border="0" alt="GoDaddy" align="right" src="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/634018601615978553.jpg" width="244" height="85" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; For the past 2 years, I have been registering domains through and hosting my web sites with GoDaddy.&#160; While I've had moderate issues with customer support, I haven't run into any issues that really made me think "it's time to move on."&#160; That was until my most recent spat regarding my emails getting marked as spam.&#160; Allow me to first explain.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I have several (6) sites hosted through my GoDaddy shared hosting account.&#160; As far as price goes, GoDaddy is fantastic.&#160; However, keep in mind that you get what you pay for.&#160; When using shared hosting through GoDaddy, if you want to send emails programmatically, through code that is, you need to use their mail relay servers.&#160; A mail relay server is essentially a box that takes in email messages and routes them out onto the internet so they get to where they need to go.&#160; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Up until the beginning of February (approximately) all of the emails I was sending through the GoDaddy mail relay were going into inboxes just fine.&#160; Keep in mind we're not talking about a lot of emails.&#160; Maybe 10 a week typically.&#160; If that many.&#160; All of a sudden around February 3rd, I realized that while people were commenting here, I wasn't getting any sort of notification.&#160; So I did the first thing I could think of: I came to my site and filled out the contact form as well as left comments.&#160; Both of which should have triggered an email.&#160; Seeing that they weren't making it into my email box, I contacted GoDaddy support.&#160; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The first request was:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Several of my websites send email through &lt;a href="http://relay-hosting.secureserver.net"&gt;relay-hosting.secureserver.net&lt;/a&gt; and as of yesterday (that I know of) none of the emails seem to be making it through (last known successful was on Jan 29th). Is there an issue with the mail server?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Their response was (paraphrased):&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you continue to experience a problem, please let us know the url of the page as well as the steps we can take to duplicate the issue.&#160; Also, here's how to take a screenshot.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While I understand that they have to offer support that both the slack jawed yokel and the software engineer can understand, no where in their response is there even a shred of an answer to the question I posed.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;My follow-up request:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;    &lt;p&gt;I guess I should clarify. I'm NOT getting an error sending an email through your web client or anything like that. I am sending emails through my asp.net web site using the goaddy relay server as specified here; &lt;a href="http://help.godaddy.com/article/955"&gt;http://help.godaddy.com/article/955&lt;/a&gt;. Up until the past couple of days, this worked fine. I have made NO code changes and DO NOT require code help.. I am NOT getting any errors when I try to email through r&lt;a href="http://elay-hosting.secureserver.net"&gt;elay-hosting.secureserver.net&lt;/a&gt; but it is not working. Can someone please check this out?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Their response (again paraphrased):&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We need to know how to reproduce this.&#160; Please give us more information.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While I was pretty sure I had specified EXACTLY how I was using their mail relay to send email through my asp.net web site, I'll give them a bone and try to be helpful.&#160; My next (we're on number 3 here) email explained how to get to my contact page and exactly what happened (again that it sent email through their relay server) when they used the form.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Their (3rd) response (paraphrased):&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What address are you expecting to receive this email on.&#160; We aren't showing any issues with our relay servers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It was at this point that I thought that maybe the emails were making it through and going to the spam folder.&#160; Sure enough, there they were.&#160; Every one had not passed the gmail or the Google Apps spam mail filter.&#160; With this in mind, I sent my 4th support request:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;    &lt;p&gt;After looking into this more on my side, I think that Google is blacklisting emails from &lt;a href="http://relay-hosting.secureserver.net"&gt;relay-hosting.secureserver.net&lt;/a&gt; If I send an email from any of my domains through &lt;a href="http://secureserver.net"&gt;secureserver.net&lt;/a&gt;'s relay, they are ending up in spam folders for gmail and google app accounts. I'm very certain it has to do with secureserver relaying the emails as when I send the emails through gmail or google apps (or any other relay I've tried using) they get to their destinations just fine. Just to stress this, the emails ONLY end up in the spam folders when sent through the secure server's relay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The important things here are that I'm stating that the emails going through their relay server are being marked as spam.&#160; However, if email is sent through the gmail (or google apps mail) interface, none of them are marked as spam.&#160; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;GoDaddy's 4th response:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;    &lt;p&gt;In case you are using a &quot;from&quot; address in your code with referring to our shared hosting email relay server, please confirm that you are not referring to a major free email provider such as Gmail as the &quot;from&quot; address, as this will most likely result in the emails being blocked.&#160;&#160; For testing / set-up purposes, we would recommend not referring t any free Web-based email service to confirm that you are referring to our email relay servers correctly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A fair point.&#160; The emails should show up as coming from my domain.&#160; Oh wait, they are.&#160; The emails were coming from either an address at this domain or an address at a different domain.&#160; Both hosted at GoDaddy, both sending emails through their relay.&#160; The important thing to remember here is that it wasn't just one domain I was having issues with.&#160; It was two separate domains.&#160; In my 5th response, I stated these things.&#160; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Their 5th response:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately we cannot control how emails are filtered by the recipient. Please note that our server admins work to keep our email servers off of block-lists. Since you do receive the messages it seems that we are not on their block-list. If you are receiving the messages in a spam, or bulk folder you will need to specify that the message is not spam to prevent this from happening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;First, I never asked them to do anything such as control how Google filter's their mail.&#160; Second, I never claimed the email servers were on a "block-list".&#160; For those of you not in the know, email providers, such as Google, use many different criteria when determining if an incoming email is spam.&#160; One of those ways is based off the "reputation" of the mail server it comes from.&#160; The idea being that as emails come through, if people say "this email is spam", that mail server's reputation goes down.&#160; Eventually it get's to a point where all emails coming from it are marked as spam by that email provider.&#160; If the mail server continues to offend, it's put on a "block-list" and emails just aren't let through at all.&#160; So while I never said the mail server was on a "block-list", I certainly wouldn't be insane thinking that maybe their mail server had been &lt;strong&gt;blacklisted&lt;/strong&gt; and the emails marked as spam.&#160; At this point, I was really just looking for them to at least own up to the possibility that their mail server's reputation was so bad, emails were getting sent directly to spam folders.&#160; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;My 6th, and final support communication:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Perhaps I am missing something that you can explain. Two separate domains that I have hosted through GoDaddy are both using GoDaddy's mail relay server. Suddenly, mail from both of these domains start failing Google's spam filter. However, when emails are sent via these email accounts (not using the relay server) they do not fail the spam filter. I think my assumption that there is an issue with the relay servers' email being marked as spam is solid. As it stands, I am unable to use a secure external relay due to port 587 being blocked. In addition, you seem unwilling or incapable of offering any real assistance. Can my ticket be escalated please?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So here, I'm laying my case out completely.&#160; Two different domains, both using the GoDaddy mail relay, have both started being sent directly to the spam folders of google mail accounts.&#160; Emails sent through these accounts NOT using the relay server (either through the mail interface or their smtp / imap clients) are not marked as spam.&#160; Furthermore, I can't switch to using gmail's SMTP mail relay to send my emails from my web site.&#160; Due to ports being blocked, GoDaddy's mail relay is my only option.&#160; At this point, I'm tired of dealing with people that can't answer any of my questions to any degree of satisfaction.&#160; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Their 6th response:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;    &lt;p&gt;As stated in our previous response, we cannot control how Google filters their mail. You will need to contact Google, or whitelist the emails to prevent them from being filtered as spam. We thank you for your understanding in this matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A complete failure to provide any assistance whatsoever.&#160; I did like that they said I could "whitelist" the emails despite a complete lack of explanation on why they might be "blackelisted" in the first place.&#160; As I can't switch to a different mail relay, as explained above, I don't really have any other options.&#160; I am currently in the process of examining alternative hosting solutions and have started recommending friends away from GoDaddy (two have already asked me questions leading to suggestions for alternate registrars and hosting solutions).&#160; I would rather start paying more for better service and actual options than continue with GoDaddy.&#160; (On a side note, GoDaddy might have 24 hour support, but when you state that there is a 2 hour wait for responses to email support questions and then take 4.5 hours to respond, your 24 hour support really doesn't mean shit).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;strong&gt;Update: 6/24/2010&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I've since moved all of my hosting off GoDaddy.

Is there an issue with the mail server?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Their response was (paraphrased):&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you continue to experience a problem, please let us know the url of the page as well as the steps we can take to duplicate the issue.&#160; Also, here's how to take a screenshot.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While I understand that they have to offer support that both the slack jawed yokel and the software engineer can understand, no where in their response is there even a shred of an answer to the question I posed.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;My follow-up request:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;    &lt;p&gt;I guess I should clarify. I'm NOT getting an error sending an email through your web client or anything like that. I am sending emails through my asp.net web site using the goaddy relay server as specified here; &lt;a href="http://help.godaddy.com/article/955"&gt;http://help.godaddy.com/article/955&lt;/a&gt;. Up until the past couple of days, this worked fine. I have made NO code changes and DO NOT require code help.. I am NOT getting any errors when I try to email through r&lt;a href="http://elay-hosting.secureserver.net"&gt;elay-hosting.secureserver.net&lt;/a&gt; but it is not working. Can someone please check this out?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Their response (again paraphrased):&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We need to know how to reproduce this.&#160; Please give us more information.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While I was pretty sure I had specified EXACTLY how I was using their mail relay to send email through my asp.net web site, I'll give them a bone and try to be helpful.&#160; My next (we're on number 3 here) email explained how to get to my contact page and exactly what happened (again that it sent email through their relay server) when they used the form.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Their (3rd) response (paraphrased):&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What address are you expecting to receive this email on.&#160; We aren't showing any issues with our relay servers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It was at this point that I thought that maybe the emails were making it through and going to the spam folder.&#160; Sure enough, there they were.&#160; Every one had not passed the gmail or the Google Apps spam mail filter.&#160; With this in mind, I sent my 4th support request:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;    &lt;p&gt;After looking into this more on my side, I think that Google is blacklisting emails from &lt;a href="http://relay-hosting.secureserver.net"&gt;relay-hosting.secureserver.net&lt;/a&gt; If I send an email from any of my domains through &lt;a href="http://secureserver.net"&gt;secureserver.net&lt;/a&gt;'s relay, they are ending up in spam folders for gmail and google app accounts. I'm very certain it has to do with secureserver relaying the emails as when I send the emails through gmail or google apps (or any other relay I've tried using) they get to their destinations just fine. Just to stress this, the emails ONLY end up in the spam folders when sent through the secure server's relay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The important things here are that I'm stating that the emails going through their relay server are being marked as spam.&#160; However, if email is sent through the gmail (or google apps mail) interface, none of them are marked as spam.&#160; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;GoDaddy's 4th response:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;    &lt;p&gt;In case you are using a &quot;from&quot; address in your code with referring to our shared hosting email relay server, please confirm that you are not referring to a major free email provider such as Gmail as the &quot;from&quot; address, as this will most likely result in the emails being blocked.&#160;&#160; For testing / set-up purposes, we would recommend not referring t any free Web-based email service to confirm that you are referring to our email relay servers correctly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A fair point.&#160; The emails should show up as coming from my domain.&#160; Oh wait, they are.&#160; The emails were coming from either an address at this domain or an address at a different domain.&#160; Both hosted at GoDaddy, both sending emails through their relay.&#160; The important thing to remember here is that it wasn't just one domain I was having issues with.&#160; It was two separate domains.&#160; In my 5th response, I stated these things.&#160; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Their 5th response:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately we cannot control how emails are filtered by the recipient. Please note that our server admins work to keep our email servers off of block-lists. Since you do receive the messages it seems that we are not on their block-list. If you are receiving the messages in a spam, or bulk folder you will need to specify that the message is not spam to prevent this from happening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;First, I never asked them to do anything such as control how Google filter's their mail.&#160; Second, I never claimed the email servers were on a "block-list".&#160; For those of you not in the know, email providers, such as Google, use many different criteria when determining if an incoming email is spam.&#160; One of those ways is based off the "reputation" of the mail server it comes from.&#160; The idea being that as emails come through, if people say "this email is spam", that mail server's reputation goes down.&#160; Eventually it get's to a point where all emails coming from it are marked as spam by that email provider.&#160; If the mail server continues to offend, it's put on a "block-list" and emails just aren't let through at all.&#160; So while I never said the mail server was on a "block-list", I certainly wouldn't be insane thinking that maybe their mail server had been &lt;strong&gt;blacklisted&lt;/strong&gt; and the emails marked as spam.&#160; At this point, I was really just looking for them to at least own up to the possibility that their mail server's reputation was so bad, emails were getting sent directly to spam folders.&#160; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;My 6th, and final support communication:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Perhaps I am missing something that you can explain. Two separate domains that I have hosted through GoDaddy are both using GoDaddy's mail relay server. Suddenly, mail from both of these domains start failing Google's spam filter. However, when emails are sent via these email accounts (not using the relay server) they do not fail the spam filter. I think my assumption that there is an issue with the relay servers' email being marked as spam is solid. As it stands, I am unable to use a secure external relay due to port 587 being blocked. In addition, you seem unwilling or incapable of offering any real assistance. Can my ticket be escalated please?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So here, I'm laying my case out completely.&#160; Two different domains, both using the GoDaddy mail relay, have both started being sent directly to the spam folders of google mail accounts.&#160; Emails sent through these accounts NOT using the relay server (either through the mail interface or their smtp / imap clients) are not marked as spam.&#160; Furthermore, I can't switch to using gmail's SMTP mail relay to send my emails from my web site.&#160; Due to ports being blocked, GoDaddy's mail relay is my only option.&#160; At this point, I'm tired of dealing with people that can't answer any of my questions to any degree of satisfaction.&#160; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Their 6th response:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;    &lt;p&gt;As stated in our previous response, we cannot control how Google filters their mail. You will need to contact Google, or whitelist the emails to prevent them from being filtered as spam. We thank you for your understanding in this matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A complete failure to provide any assistance whatsoever.&#160; I did like that they said I could "whitelist" the emails despite a complete lack of explanation on why they might be "blackelisted" in the first place.&#160; As I can't switch to a different mail relay, as explained above, I don't really have any other options.&#160; I am currently in the process of examining alternative hosting solutions and have started recommending friends away from GoDaddy (two have already asked me questions leading to suggestions for alternate registrars and hosting solutions).&#160; I would rather start paying more for better service and actual options than continue with GoDaddy.&#160; (On a side note, GoDaddy might have 24 hour support, but when you state that there is a 2 hour wait for responses to email support questions and then take 4.5 hours to respond, your 24 hour support really doesn't mean shit).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;strong&gt;Update: 6/24/2010&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I've since moved all of my hosting off GoDaddy.

They provide a link to a &lt;a title="Equal Heights Javascript" href="http://www.dynamicdrive.com/style/blog/entry/css-equal-columns-height-script/"&gt;javascript file that makes your columns have equal heights&lt;/a&gt;.&#160; So on page load, all of the columns were made to have the same height.&#160; However, the problem still existed when I toggled the display on my comment div.&#160; What I needed to do was recall the functionality in the equal heights JavaScript.&#160; Pulling that into a callable function was easy enough (&lt;a title="Equal Columns JS" href="http://chrisrisner.com/scripts/equalcolumns.js"&gt;and can be found here&lt;/a&gt;).&#160; What you can also see there is a near duplicate method that, when called, does a reset on the setHeights method.&#160; I could have just added a parameter to the FixColumns method but as I was testing it out, I didn't, and clearly I was too lazy to go back and do it right (I'll have to fix that in the future).&#160; So now, if I call the FixColumns2 method after I show or hide the comments, it should all be fixed right?&#160;&#160; Well, if the comments div is fully expanded when FixColumns2 is called, then yes.&#160; However, since I got rid of the animation above, I wanted to make the comments div appear a little more elegantly.&#160; So instead of just calling the toggle method on my div, I switched up to calling slideToggle.&#160; Now my comments div gracefully expands instead of just impaling itself onto the page.&#160; However, now that the div isn't at full height right away, if we call FixColumns2 and reprocess the column heights right away, we'll only have the height of the div as far as it's expanded.&#160; So instead of just calling FixColumns2 right away, we need to delay the start.&#160; Thankfully the functionality is already provided with the setTimeout method.&#160; So now, we call setTimeout('FixColumns2()', 1000); and one second later, the heights are reprocessed and the page looks correct again.&#160; In the future, I'd like to change this into a pure CSS way of handling it so that I'm not stuck with JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Lastly, I added a custom google search box to the right side of the page.&#160; Now you can happily search through all the delicious content of the site.&#160; Have fun!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><dsq:thread_identifier>A-Few-Web-Fixes</dsq:thread_identifier><wp:post_date_gmt>2010-02-23 01:00:00.000</wp:post_date_gmt><wp:comment_status>open</wp:comment_status><wp:comment><dsq:remote><dsq:id>18</dsq:id><dsq:avatar/></dsq:remote><wp:comment_id>122</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Stavos</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>stavos@gmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://www.detroitarchive.com</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>165.215.94.12</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2010-02-23 08:59:59.503</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content>I miss that crazy animation I grew to love.

They provide a link to a &lt;a title="Equal Heights Javascript" href="http://www.dynamicdrive.com/style/blog/entry/css-equal-columns-height-script/"&gt;javascript file that makes your columns have equal heights&lt;/a&gt;.&#160; So on page load, all of the columns were made to have the same height.&#160; However, the problem still existed when I toggled the display on my comment div.&#160; What I needed to do was recall the functionality in the equal heights JavaScript.&#160; Pulling that into a callable function was easy enough (&lt;a title="Equal Columns JS" href="http://chrisrisner.com/scripts/equalcolumns.js"&gt;and can be found here&lt;/a&gt;).&#160; What you can also see there is a near duplicate method that, when called, does a reset on the setHeights method.&#160; I could have just added a parameter to the FixColumns method but as I was testing it out, I didn't, and clearly I was too lazy to go back and do it right (I'll have to fix that in the future).&#160; So now, if I call the FixColumns2 method after I show or hide the comments, it should all be fixed right?&#160;&#160; Well, if the comments div is fully expanded when FixColumns2 is called, then yes.&#160; However, since I got rid of the animation above, I wanted to make the comments div appear a little more elegantly.&#160; So instead of just calling the toggle method on my div, I switched up to calling slideToggle.&#160; Now my comments div gracefully expands instead of just impaling itself onto the page.&#160; However, now that the div isn't at full height right away, if we call FixColumns2 and reprocess the column heights right away, we'll only have the height of the div as far as it's expanded.&#160; So instead of just calling FixColumns2 right away, we need to delay the start.&#160; Thankfully the functionality is already provided with the setTimeout method.&#160; So now, we call setTimeout('FixColumns2()', 1000); and one second later, the heights are reprocessed and the page looks correct again.&#160; In the future, I'd like to change this into a pure CSS way of handling it so that I'm not stuck with JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Lastly, I added a custom google search box to the right side of the page.&#160; Now you can happily search through all the delicious content of the site.&#160; Have fun!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><dsq:thread_identifier>A-Few-Web-Fixes</dsq:thread_identifier><wp:post_date_gmt>2010-02-23 01:00:00.000</wp:post_date_gmt><wp:comment_status>open</wp:comment_status><wp:comment><dsq:remote><dsq:id>34</dsq:id><dsq:avatar/></dsq:remote><wp:comment_id>123</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Mat</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>mpiccinato@gmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://mpiccinato.net</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>12.165.188.130</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2010-02-24 09:12:05.747</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content>Look at that nice fluid animation on these comments.

margin: 0px 0px 0px 10px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="Gravatars" border="0" alt="Gravatars" align="right" src="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/634030785250603191.jpg" width="52" height="244" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; While most of what these people add to the internet is absolute garbage, many people like other people to know when they've said something.&#160; One of the ways people are doing this is through the use of Gravatars.&#160; &lt;a title="Gravatars" href="http://gravatar.com"&gt;Gravatars&lt;/a&gt; are small images that (can) uniquely identify you as a commenter or contributor on a website, typically a blog.&#160; For example, if you go and look at the comments on this site, you'll see that any comment I've made has a small image of morlock next to it.&#160; Any other site that I comment on that uses gravatars will show the exact same image.&#160; Due to the way it's set up, where a site will set an image's source to be a gravatar.com url, I could change my image on all of these sites whenever I want to.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Recently while commenting on a session for &lt;a title="Mix2010" href="http://live.visitmix.com/"&gt;Mix, a conference I'm attending&lt;/a&gt; in a couple weeks, I noticed that as soon as you entered your email address, it would show your gravatar.&#160; Figuring that this would be a nice little addition to my site, I added it a few days ago.&#160; Since many people do use Gravatars, I thought I'd demonstrate an easy way to add this to your web site.&#160; The sample I'm showing specifically applies to ASP .Net MVC, but it could be taken and easily altered for other applications.&#160; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Our example will consist of three parts:&#160; the view, the javascript, and the controller method.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The View is very simple and just contains a field that we can put our email address in and an image tag that can have it's source set later:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class="csharpcode"&gt;   &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   1:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="html"&gt;dl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   2:  &lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="html"&gt;dt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="html"&gt;label&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="attr"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;=&quot;EmailAddress&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Email Address:&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="html"&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&gt;&lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="html"&gt;dt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   3:  &lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="html"&gt;dd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   4:  &lt;/span&gt;          &lt;span class="asp"&gt;&lt;%&lt;/span&gt;=Html.TextBox(&lt;span class="str"&gt;&quot;Email&quot;&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;span class="asp"&gt;%&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   5:  &lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="html"&gt;dd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   6:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="html"&gt;dl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   7:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="html"&gt;br&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   8:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="html"&gt;img&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="attr"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;=&quot;newgravatar&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="attr"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;=&quot;Gravatar&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;style type="text/css"&gt;  .csharpcode, .csharpcode pre  {   font-size: small;   color: black;   font-family: consolas, "Courier New", courier, monospace;   background-color: #ffffff;   /*white-space: pre;*/  }  .csharpcode pre { margin: 0em;

}&lt;/style&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Our javascript is a bit more complex and shows an example of using ajax to go back to the server to get the path to our email address' gravatar:&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;div class="csharpcode"&gt;    &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   1:  &lt;/span&gt;window._emailRegex = /^[a-z0-9]+([-+\.]*[a-z0-9]+)*@[a-z0-9]+([-\.][a-z0-9]+)*$/i;&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   2:  &lt;/span&gt;&#160;&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   3:  &lt;/span&gt;$(document).ready(&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;() {&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   4:  &lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="rem"&gt;//Gravatar stuff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   5:  &lt;/span&gt;    $(&lt;span class="str"&gt;'input[name=Email]'&lt;/span&gt;).blur(&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;() {&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   6:  &lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; email = $(&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;).val();&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   7:  &lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (email.indexOf(&lt;span class="str"&gt;&quot;@&quot;&lt;/span&gt;) &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; window._emailRegex.test(email)) {&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   8:  &lt;/span&gt;            $.post(&lt;span class="str"&gt;'/Home/GetGravatarPath'&lt;/span&gt;, { value: email }, &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;(gravatarPath) {&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   9:  &lt;/span&gt;                $(&lt;span class="str"&gt;'img.newgravatar'&lt;/span&gt;).attr(&lt;span class="str"&gt;'src'&lt;/span&gt;, gravatarPath);&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  10:  &lt;/span&gt;            });&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  11:  &lt;/span&gt;        }&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  12:  &lt;/span&gt;    });&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  13:  &lt;/span&gt;});&lt;/pre&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;style type="text/css"&gt;  .csharpcode, .csharpcode pre  {   font-size: small;

}&lt;/style&gt;You'll notice here that we're also checking up against a regex to make sure the email address entered is valid.&#160; Once we're sure it is, we'll post back to a method on our Home controller.&#160; The result of that method call is then set to the source attribute of the image with newgravatar as it's class.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Lastly, we have our controller method:&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;div class="csharpcode"&gt;    &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   1:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; GetGravatarPath(&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   2:  &lt;/span&gt;{&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   3:  &lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; Gravatar.GetGravatarURL(&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;);&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   4:  &lt;/span&gt;}&lt;/pre&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;style type="text/css"&gt;  .csharpcode, .csharpcode pre  {   font-size: small;   color: black;   font-family: consolas, "Courier New", courier, monospace;   background-color: #ffffff;   /*white-space: pre;*/  }  .csharpcode pre { margin: 0em; }  .csharpcode .rem { color: #008000; }  .csharpcode .kwrd { color: #0000ff; }  .csharpcode .str { color: #006080; }  .csharpcode .op { color: #0000c0;

  width: 100%;   margin: 0em;  }  .csharpcode .lnum { color: #606060; }&lt;/style&gt;    &lt;p&gt;and the class that method calls to actually get the path:&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;div class="csharpcode"&gt;    &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   1:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; Gravatar&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;

&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; GetGravatarURL(&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; emailAddress)&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   4:  &lt;/span&gt;     {&lt;/pre&gt;

     &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   9:  &lt;/span&gt;&#160;&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  10:  &lt;/span&gt;          StringBuilder sb = &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;

+ sb.ToString();&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  17:  &lt;/span&gt;          imageUrl += &lt;span class="str"&gt;&quot;&amp;size=40&quot;&lt;/span&gt;;&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;

As you can see, we can create the path without actually ever having to go to gravatar.com.&#160; Instead we just use the agreed upon algorithm and return that url.&#160; That url is then used as the image source above in our javascript.&#160; After all this, we have an "ajaxy" way of displaying our commenter's gravatars that looks pretty slick and was only 47% stolen from the Mix site.&#160; Enjoy!    &lt;p&gt;Source code: &lt;a title="source code download" href="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/634030788465554231.zip"&gt;download&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><dsq:thread_identifier>How-to-Quickly-Show-a-Gravatar</dsq:thread_identifier><wp:post_date_gmt>2010-03-01 23:34:00.000</wp:post_date_gmt><wp:comment_status>open</wp:comment_status><wp:comment><dsq:remote><dsq:id>12</dsq:id><dsq:avatar/></dsq:remote><wp:comment_id>131</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>AtomicInternet</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>atomicinternet@gmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://atomicinternet.homeip.net</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>12.165.188.130</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2010-03-09 13:05:22.560</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content>Theft in progress!</wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment></item>

margin: 0px 0px 0px 10px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="Gravatars" border="0" alt="Gravatars" align="right" src="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/634030785250603191.jpg" width="52" height="244" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; While most of what these people add to the internet is absolute garbage, many people like other people to know when they've said something.&#160; One of the ways people are doing this is through the use of Gravatars.&#160; &lt;a title="Gravatars" href="http://gravatar.com"&gt;Gravatars&lt;/a&gt; are small images that (can) uniquely identify you as a commenter or contributor on a website, typically a blog.&#160; For example, if you go and look at the comments on this site, you'll see that any comment I've made has a small image of morlock next to it.&#160; Any other site that I comment on that uses gravatars will show the exact same image.&#160; Due to the way it's set up, where a site will set an image's source to be a gravatar.com url, I could change my image on all of these sites whenever I want to.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Recently while commenting on a session for &lt;a title="Mix2010" href="http://live.visitmix.com/"&gt;Mix, a conference I'm attending&lt;/a&gt; in a couple weeks, I noticed that as soon as you entered your email address, it would show your gravatar.&#160; Figuring that this would be a nice little addition to my site, I added it a few days ago.&#160; Since many people do use Gravatars, I thought I'd demonstrate an easy way to add this to your web site.&#160; The sample I'm showing specifically applies to ASP .Net MVC, but it could be taken and easily altered for other applications.&#160; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Our example will consist of three parts:&#160; the view, the javascript, and the controller method.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The View is very simple and just contains a field that we can put our email address in and an image tag that can have it's source set later:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class="csharpcode"&gt;   &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   1:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="html"&gt;dl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   2:  &lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="html"&gt;dt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="html"&gt;label&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="attr"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;=&quot;EmailAddress&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Email Address:&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="html"&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&gt;&lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="html"&gt;dt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   3:  &lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="html"&gt;dd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   4:  &lt;/span&gt;          &lt;span class="asp"&gt;&lt;%&lt;/span&gt;=Html.TextBox(&lt;span class="str"&gt;&quot;Email&quot;&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;span class="asp"&gt;%&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   5:  &lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="html"&gt;dd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   6:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="html"&gt;dl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   7:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="html"&gt;br&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   8:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="html"&gt;img&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="attr"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;=&quot;newgravatar&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

   &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   1:  &lt;/span&gt;window._emailRegex = /^[a-z0-9]+([-+\.]*[a-z0-9]+)*@[a-z0-9]+([-\.][a-z0-9]+)*$/i;&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;

The result of that method call is then set to the source attribute of the image with newgravatar as it's class.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Lastly, we have our controller method:&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;div class="csharpcode"&gt;    &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   1:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; GetGravatarPath(&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; Gravatar.GetGravatarURL(&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;);&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   4:  &lt;/span&gt;}&lt;/pre&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;style type="text/css"&gt;  .csharpcode, .csharpcode pre  {   font-size: small;   color: black;   font-family: consolas, "Courier New", courier, monospace;   background-color: #ffffff;

  width: 100%;   margin: 0em;  }  .csharpcode .lnum { color: #606060; }&lt;/style&gt;    &lt;p&gt;and the class that method calls to actually get the path:&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;div class="csharpcode"&gt;    &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   1:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; Gravatar&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;

margin: 0px 0px 0px 10px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="Gravatars" border="0" alt="Gravatars" align="right" src="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/634030785250603191.jpg" width="52" height="244" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; While most of what these people add to the internet is absolute garbage, many people like other people to know when they've said something.&#160; One of the ways people are doing this is through the use of Gravatars.&#160; &lt;a title="Gravatars" href="http://gravatar.com"&gt;Gravatars&lt;/a&gt; are small images that (can) uniquely identify you as a commenter or contributor on a website, typically a blog.&#160; For example, if you go and look at the comments on this site, you'll see that any comment I've made has a small image of morlock next to it.&#160; Any other site that I comment on that uses gravatars will show the exact same image.&#160; Due to the way it's set up, where a site will set an image's source to be a gravatar.com url, I could change my image on all of these sites whenever I want to.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Recently while commenting on a session for &lt;a title="Mix2010" href="http://live.visitmix.com/"&gt;Mix, a conference I'm attending&lt;/a&gt; in a couple weeks, I noticed that as soon as you entered your email address, it would show your gravatar.&#160; Figuring that this would be a nice little addition to my site, I added it a few days ago.&#160; Since many people do use Gravatars, I thought I'd demonstrate an easy way to add this to your web site.&#160; The sample I'm showing specifically applies to ASP .Net MVC, but it could be taken and easily altered for other applications.&#160; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Our example will consist of three parts:&#160; the view, the javascript, and the controller method.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The View is very simple and just contains a field that we can put our email address in and an image tag that can have it's source set later:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class="csharpcode"&gt;   &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   1:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="html"&gt;dl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   2:  &lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="html"&gt;dt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="html"&gt;label&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="attr"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;=&quot;EmailAddress&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Email Address:&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="html"&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&gt;&lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="html"&gt;dt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   3:  &lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="html"&gt;dd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   4:  &lt;/span&gt;          &lt;span class="asp"&gt;&lt;%&lt;/span&gt;=Html.TextBox(&lt;span class="str"&gt;&quot;Email&quot;&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;span class="asp"&gt;%&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   5:  &lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="html"&gt;dd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   6:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="html"&gt;dl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   7:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="html"&gt;br&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   8:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="html"&gt;img&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="attr"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;=&quot;newgravatar&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="attr"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;=&quot;Gravatar&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;style type="text/css"&gt;  .csharpcode, .csharpcode pre  {   font-size: small;   color: black;   font-family: consolas, "Courier New", courier, monospace;   background-color: #ffffff;   /*white-space: pre;*/  }  .csharpcode pre { margin: 0em;

}&lt;/style&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Our javascript is a bit more complex and shows an example of using ajax to go back to the server to get the path to our email address' gravatar:&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;div class="csharpcode"&gt;    &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   1:  &lt;/span&gt;window._emailRegex = /^[a-z0-9]+([-+\.]*[a-z0-9]+)*@[a-z0-9]+([-\.][a-z0-9]+)*$/i;&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   2:  &lt;/span&gt;&#160;&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   3:  &lt;/span&gt;$(document).ready(&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;() {&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   4:  &lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="rem"&gt;//Gravatar stuff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   5:  &lt;/span&gt;    $(&lt;span class="str"&gt;'input[name=Email]'&lt;/span&gt;).blur(&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;() {&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   6:  &lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; email = $(&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;).val();&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   7:  &lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (email.indexOf(&lt;span class="str"&gt;&quot;@&quot;&lt;/span&gt;) &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; window._emailRegex.test(email)) {&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   8:  &lt;/span&gt;            $.post(&lt;span class="str"&gt;'/Home/GetGravatarPath'&lt;/span&gt;, { value: email }, &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;(gravatarPath) {&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   9:  &lt;/span&gt;                $(&lt;span class="str"&gt;'img.newgravatar'&lt;/span&gt;).attr(&lt;span class="str"&gt;'src'&lt;/span&gt;, gravatarPath);&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  10:  &lt;/span&gt;            });&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  11:  &lt;/span&gt;        }&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  12:  &lt;/span&gt;    });&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  13:  &lt;/span&gt;});&lt;/pre&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;style type="text/css"&gt;  .csharpcode, .csharpcode pre  {   font-size: small;

}&lt;/style&gt;You'll notice here that we're also checking up against a regex to make sure the email address entered is valid.&#160; Once we're sure it is, we'll post back to a method on our Home controller.&#160; The result of that method call is then set to the source attribute of the image with newgravatar as it's class.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Lastly, we have our controller method:&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;div class="csharpcode"&gt;    &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   1:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; GetGravatarPath(&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   2:  &lt;/span&gt;{&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   3:  &lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; Gravatar.GetGravatarURL(&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;);&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   4:  &lt;/span&gt;}&lt;/pre&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;style type="text/css"&gt;  .csharpcode, .csharpcode pre  {   font-size: small;   color: black;   font-family: consolas, "Courier New", courier, monospace;   background-color: #ffffff;   /*white-space: pre;*/  }  .csharpcode pre { margin: 0em; }  .csharpcode .rem { color: #008000; }  .csharpcode .kwrd { color: #0000ff; }  .csharpcode .str { color: #006080; }  .csharpcode .op { color: #0000c0;

  width: 100%;   margin: 0em;  }  .csharpcode .lnum { color: #606060; }&lt;/style&gt;    &lt;p&gt;and the class that method calls to actually get the path:&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;div class="csharpcode"&gt;    &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   1:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; Gravatar&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;

So far it has been an incredible experience.&#160; Coming into the conference, everyone knew that they were going to be mentioning Windows Phone 7.&#160; The first keynote ended up focusing almost entirely on it.&#160; The big things from the first&#160; and part of the second day regarding the Windows Phone 7 are:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ul&gt;   &lt;li&gt;Developing for the Windows Phone 7 is going to be free.&#160; The current development tools are already &lt;a title="Windows Phone 7 Tools" href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=2338b5d1-79d8-46af-b828-380b0f854203&amp;displaylang=en" target="_blank"&gt;available here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;The Windows Phone 7 will run a subset of Silverlight 3.&#160; Not the new 4.0 release.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;WP7 will now allow background running apps (similar to iPhone) but will support notifications for other apps to be displayed.&#160; &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;WP7 is ditching ActiveSync in favor of the Zune interface.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;All apps will have to be distributed via the &lt;a title="Windows Mobile Marketplace" href="http://marketplace.windowsphone.com/Default.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;Windows Phone Marketplace&lt;/a&gt;.&#160; They do support a "Try before you Buy" option but there isn't going to be any capability to distribute apps privately (i.e. if you wanted to distribute them to all the WP7s connected to your work network) in this release.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;WP7 is capable of watching NetFlix on the go.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;WP7 will wirelessly sync your data (pictures, contacts, etc) when it is charging and detects your home network.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Apps for WP7 will be developed in either Silverlight for WP7 or XNA for WP7.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;There is no cut and paste (YET!) in WP7.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;WP7 will launch sometime around Holiday 2010.&#160; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;p&gt;They blatantly stated that the first release (re: Holiday 2010) is focused on the consumer and not business users.&#160; I'm hoping they'll at least put in the email / exchange calendar syncing they currently have in WinMo 6.5 so that WP7 will at least be usable at a business level but that remains to be seen.&#160; The huge focus seemed to be on streaming media and integration with social networks.&#160; For example, there wasn't a "Facebook app" per say, but you could go to your photos and see photos your friends had added to Facebook and comment on them.&#160; All of this from INSIDE the WP7 interface.&#160; The phone DOES have some capability to have background running programs but it won't be available to third party developers for this release.&#160; The example they showed was music.&#160; You could play a song and then leave music and go to a different app and have it continuing to play music.&#160; All that said, development for WP7 seems remarkably easy.&#160; I had the Dev tools installed in the session following the keynote and had a Hello World app running minutes later.&#160; Since there aren't really any actual phone units available to dev against (the rumor mill was abuzz on Monday saying that they'd be handing out dev units) the dev tools come with a WP7 emulator.&#160; The biggest issue with the emulator is that it doesn't actually emulate the hardware of the WP7.&#160; This makes sense from a performance during development point of view, however, it means that your app isn't guaranteed to run the same on the emulator as it is on the WP7.&#160; I'm excited to play around and hope to make some more WP7 apps soon.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In other news, they also announced more formally the release of the &lt;a title="Open Data Protocol" href="http://www.odata.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Open Data Protocol&lt;/a&gt;.&#160; ODP is a standard way of making data available via a "web service interface" so that the data can be filtered and accessed via a url based querying system.&#160; So instead of passing over specific parameters to get whatever specific data you want (and the developer having to code all of those methods) creating an OData service, handles all of that for you.&#160; The example they demonstrated was a &lt;a title="Netflix OData" href="http://developer.netflix.com/blog/read/Announcing_the_OData_Catalog_API_Preview" target="_blank"&gt;Netflix ODATA feed&lt;/a&gt; that allowed you to get any sort of data about movies, the actors in them, etc.&#160; They also showed off "codename Dallas" which was a way to publicize and sell your data service.&#160; Lastly, they also announced the &lt;a title="IE9 Testdrive" href="http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/" target="_blank"&gt;IE9 Test Drive&lt;/a&gt;.&#160;&#160; IE9 still needs some work but it's hardware acceleration of HTML5 looks pretty impressive.&#160; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One last thing.&#160; I had a chance to talk briefly with &lt;a title="Adam Kinney" href="http://adamkinney.wordpress.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Adam Kinney&lt;/a&gt; who is a tech evangelist at Microsoft for Expression Studio and Silverlight.&#160; He's an awfully smart guy with a lot of passion for design.&#160; He pointed me at &lt;a title="Design Toolbox" href="http://www.microsoft.com/design/toolbox/" target="_blank"&gt;this Design Toolbox site&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;WP7 is ditching ActiveSync in favor of the Zune interface.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;All apps will have to be distributed via the &lt;a title="Windows Mobile Marketplace" href="http://marketplace.windowsphone.com/Default.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;Windows Phone Marketplace&lt;/a&gt;.&#160; They do support a "Try before you Buy" option but there isn't going to be any capability to distribute apps privately (i.e. if you wanted to distribute them to all the WP7s connected to your work network) in this release.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;WP7 is capable of watching NetFlix on the go.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;WP7 will wirelessly sync your data (pictures, contacts, etc) when it is charging and detects your home network.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Apps for WP7 will be developed in either Silverlight for WP7 or XNA for WP7.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;There is no cut and paste (YET!) in WP7.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;WP7 will launch sometime around Holiday 2010.&#160; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;p&gt;They blatantly stated that the first release (re: Holiday 2010) is focused on the consumer and not business users.&#160; I'm hoping they'll at least put in the email / exchange calendar syncing they currently have in WinMo 6.5 so that WP7 will at least be usable at a business level but that remains to be seen.&#160; The huge focus seemed to be on streaming media and integration with social networks.&#160; For example, there wasn't a "Facebook app" per say, but you could go to your photos and see photos your friends had added to Facebook and comment on them.&#160; All of this from INSIDE the WP7 interface.&#160; The phone DOES have some capability to have background running programs but it won't be available to third party developers for this release.&#160; The example they showed was music.&#160; You could play a song and then leave music and go to a different app and have it continuing to play music.&#160; All that said, development for WP7 seems remarkably easy.&#160; I had the Dev tools installed in the session following the keynote and had a Hello World app running minutes later.&#160; Since there aren't really any actual phone units available to dev against (the rumor mill was abuzz on Monday saying that they'd be handing out dev units) the dev tools come with a WP7 emulator.&#160; The biggest issue with the emulator is that it doesn't actually emulate the hardware of the WP7.&#160; This makes sense from a performance during development point of view, however, it means that your app isn't guaranteed to run the same on the emulator as it is on the WP7.&#160; I'm excited to play around and hope to make some more WP7 apps soon.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In other news, they also announced more formally the release of the &lt;a title="Open Data Protocol" href="http://www.odata.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Open Data Protocol&lt;/a&gt;.&#160; ODP is a standard way of making data available via a "web service interface" so that the data can be filtered and accessed via a url based querying system.&#160; So instead of passing over specific parameters to get whatever specific data you want (and the developer having to code all of those methods) creating an OData service, handles all of that for you.&#160; The example they demonstrated was a &lt;a title="Netflix OData" href="http://developer.netflix.com/blog/read/Announcing_the_OData_Catalog_API_Preview" target="_blank"&gt;Netflix ODATA feed&lt;/a&gt; that allowed you to get any sort of data about movies, the actors in them, etc.&#160; They also showed off "codename Dallas" which was a way to publicize and sell your data service.&#160; Lastly, they also announced the &lt;a title="IE9 Testdrive" href="http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/" target="_blank"&gt;IE9 Test Drive&lt;/a&gt;.&#160;&#160; IE9 still needs some work but it's hardware acceleration of HTML5 looks pretty impressive.&#160; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One last thing.&#160; I had a chance to talk briefly with &lt;a title="Adam Kinney" href="http://adamkinney.wordpress.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Adam Kinney&lt;/a&gt; who is a tech evangelist at Microsoft for Expression Studio and Silverlight.&#160; He's an awfully smart guy with a lot of passion for design.&#160; He pointed me at &lt;a title="Design Toolbox" href="http://www.microsoft.com/design/toolbox/" target="_blank"&gt;this Design Toolbox site&lt;/a&gt; which tries to make learning about design fun and easy.&#160; I'm looking forward to going through that site a lot once I get back to Michigan and have more time available.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><dsq:thread_identifier>Mix-10-Days-1and-2</dsq:thread_identifier><wp:post_date_gmt>2010-03-16 16:50:00.000</wp:post_date_gmt><wp:comment_status>open</wp:comment_status><wp:comment><dsq:remote><dsq:id>35</dsq:id><dsq:avatar/></dsq:remote><wp:comment_id>140</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Keith</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>keith@keithelder.net</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://keithelder.net</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>12.165.188.130</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2010-03-17 09:26:17.173</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content>Good recap there sparky.  I'm all about OData and the things we can do with it.  Already built out OData around core logger to allow anyone to get at their logs. Really nice, opens the door for people to do some neat things with the data like make custom alert monitors or whatever.</wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment></item>

Outside of just getting our order, I don't think he said more than two words to us the entire evening.&#160; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It gave me the impression that as we appeared younger than the people around us, he just didn't care about our level of service.&#160; Finally, the thing that really put a black spot on my evening, and did the most to lessen my chances of returning, he picked up our bill before we had even walked out of the restaurant.&#160; Not only did he pick it up while we were putting our coats on at the table, he opened it to look at the tip we gave him.&#160; He might as well have just said &quot;you look like cheap jerks&quot;.&#160; Even after the previous issues, we still left him an over 15% tip.&#160; In hindsight, he deserved much less.&#160; While I will stress again that the food was wonderful, the level of service was extremely poor, and is something I will definitely consider before returning to a Muer restaurant in the future. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A few days later I submitted my comments regarding our evening to Big Fish's "Guest Comments" on their web site.&#160; 4 days later I received a response from William at Landry's Restaurants.&#160; Landry's purchased Big Fish from the Muer restaurant group sometime after Charley Muer was lost at sea.&#160; Instead of actually commenting in ANY WAY on my issue, the email was a canned response asking for my phone number so we could speak in person.&#160; 3 days later, on February 22nd, I replied with my phone number.&#160; As of this post (March 25th), I have still not heard from anyone at Landry's via phone or email.&#160; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The worst part about this whole affair is that the food was really good.&#160; However, with the service we received and the shoddy attempt at doing anything to correct it by Landry's, I don't think I can see myself ever returning to Big Fish or EVER visiting a Landry's restaurant in the future.&#160; I even went so far as to &lt;a title="Big Fish on Yelp" href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/big-fish-dearborn" target="_blank"&gt;share these thoughts on Yelp&lt;/a&gt;.&#160; This is a perfect example of a situation that &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; have been fixed with minimal effort but was botched so horribly, it's irrevocably left a mark on me.&#160; Oh well, not it's like I like &lt;a title="Going Out To Eat" href="http://chrisrisner.com/Detroit-Restaurant-Week-2010" target="_blank"&gt;going out to eat or doing anything food related&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><dsq:thread_identifier>Landry's-and-Big-Fish-serves-up-Bad-Service</dsq:thread_identifier><wp:post_date_gmt>2010-03-25 23:55:00.000</wp:post_date_gmt><wp:comment_status>open</wp:comment_status><wp:comment><dsq:remote><dsq:id>36</dsq:id><dsq:avatar/></dsq:remote><wp:comment_id>141</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Diane</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>risner2@gmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>69.14.147.81</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2010-03-26 07:05:47.560</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content>My husband and I have been members of the &quot;Friends&quot; dining club for many years, and have frequented Big Fish in Dearborn, as well as Ann Arbor's Gandy Dancer and Troy's Charley's Crab.  I can honestly say that we have never had a bad meal at any of these locations.  However, after reading this review, I doubt we will waste our time making the 30 minute drive to Dearborn to experience incompetent service.  Shame on the management at Big Fish for letting something like this ruin what should have been a wonderful dining experience.  Their lack of response is totally unprofessional.</wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment></item>

Outside of just getting our order, I don't think he said more than two words to us the entire evening.&#160; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It gave me the impression that as we appeared younger than the people around us, he just didn't care about our level of service.&#160; Finally, the thing that really put a black spot on my evening, and did the most to lessen my chances of returning, he picked up our bill before we had even walked out of the restaurant.&#160; Not only did he pick it up while we were putting our coats on at the table, he opened it to look at the tip we gave him.&#160; He might as well have just said &quot;you look like cheap jerks&quot;.&#160; Even after the previous issues, we still left him an over 15% tip.&#160; In hindsight, he deserved much less.&#160; While I will stress again that the food was wonderful, the level of service was extremely poor, and is something I will definitely consider before returning to a Muer restaurant in the future. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A few days later I submitted my comments regarding our evening to Big Fish's "Guest Comments" on their web site.&#160; 4 days later I received a response from William at Landry's Restaurants.&#160; Landry's purchased Big Fish from the Muer restaurant group sometime after Charley Muer was lost at sea.&#160; Instead of actually commenting in ANY WAY on my issue, the email was a canned response asking for my phone number so we could speak in person.&#160; 3 days later, on February 22nd, I replied with my phone number.&#160; As of this post (March 25th), I have still not heard from anyone at Landry's via phone or email.&#160; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The worst part about this whole affair is that the food was really good.&#160; However, with the service we received and the shoddy attempt at doing anything to correct it by Landry's, I don't think I can see myself ever returning to Big Fish or EVER visiting a Landry's restaurant in the future.&#160; I even went so far as to &lt;a title="Big Fish on Yelp" href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/big-fish-dearborn" target="_blank"&gt;share these thoughts on Yelp&lt;/a&gt;.&#160; This is a perfect example of a situation that &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; have been fixed with minimal effort but was botched so horribly, it's irrevocably left a mark on me.&#160; Oh well, not it's like I like &lt;a title="Going Out To Eat" href="http://chrisrisner.com/Detroit-Restaurant-Week-2010" target="_blank"&gt;going out to eat or doing anything food related&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><dsq:thread_identifier>Landry's-and-Big-Fish-serves-up-Bad-Service</dsq:thread_identifier><wp:post_date_gmt>2010-03-25 23:55:00.000</wp:post_date_gmt><wp:comment_status>open</wp:comment_status><wp:comment><dsq:remote><dsq:id>12</dsq:id><dsq:avatar/></dsq:remote><wp:comment_id>144</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>AtomicInternet</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>atomicinternet@gmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://atomicinternet.homeip.net</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>12.165.188.130</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2010-03-29 10:38:09.117</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content>I've started at Kyle B fan club, who wants to join?</wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment></item>

<item><title>re: MVC2 - Adding Data Annotation Validation for Entity Framework Entities</title><link>http://chrisrisner.com/MVC2-%E2%80%93-Adding-Data-Annotation-Validation-for-Entity-Framework-Entities</link><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 10px; display: inline" align="right" src="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/634062222138168483.jpg" /&gt; I was hoping to wait for .Net 4.0 to drop before I started making a real MVC2 work application but just got the opportunity to rewrite a smaller existing web project.&#160; MVC2 for .Net 3.5 seemed a logical choice.&#160; In addition to finally getting MVC2 into a project, I wanted to try messing around with Entity Framework.&#160; Being decently skilled with LINQ-to-SQL, getting some experience with it's successor, Entity Framework, seemed like a wise idea.&#160; After creating my models and adding some controllers and views.&#160; It was time to start testing out the new DataAnnotation validation.&#160; DataAnnotations allow you to place attributes on your entities' properties which handle making sure they are valid.&#160; So for example, if I had an ApplicationName property that I wanted to both require, and mandate that it was no longer than 50 characters, I could do the following:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div id="codeSnippetWrapper"&gt;   &lt;div style="border-bottom-style: none; text-align: left; padding-bottom: 0px; line-height: 12pt; border-right-style: none; background-color: #f4f4f4; padding-left: 0px; width: 100%; padding-right: 0px; font-family: &#39;Courier New&#39;, courier, monospace; direction: ltr; border-top-style: none; color: black; font-size: 8pt; border-left-style: none; overflow: visible; padding-top: 0px" id="codeSnippet"&gt;     &lt;pre style="border-bottom-style: none; text-align: left; padding-bottom: 0px; line-height: 12pt; border-right-style: none; background-color: white; margin: 0em; padding-left: 0px; width: 100%; padding-right: 0px; font-family: &#39;Courier New&#39;, courier, monospace; direction: ltr; border-top-style: none; color: black; font-size: 8pt; border-left-style: none; overflow: visible; padding-top: 0px"&gt;&lt;span style="color: #606060" id="lnum1"&gt;   1:&lt;/span&gt; [Required(ErrorMessage = &lt;span style="color: #006080"&gt;&quot;Application Name Required&quot;&lt;/span&gt;)]&lt;/pre&gt;  &lt;!--CRLF--&gt;        &lt;pre style="border-bottom-style: none; text-align: left; padding-bottom: 0px; line-height: 12pt; border-right-style: none; background-color: #f4f4f4; margin: 0em; padding-left: 0px; width: 100%; padding-right: 0px; font-family: &#39;Courier New&#39;, courier, monospace;

[StringLength(50, ErrorMessage = &lt;span style="color: #006080"&gt;&quot;Application name must be under 50 characters&quot;&lt;/span&gt;)]&lt;/pre&gt;  &lt;!--CRLF--&gt;        &lt;pre style="border-bottom-style: none; text-align: left; padding-bottom: 0px; line-height: 12pt; border-right-style: none; background-color: white; margin: 0em; padding-left: 0px; width: 100%; padding-right: 0px; font-family: &#39;Courier New&#39;, courier, monospace; direction: ltr; border-top-style: none; color: black; font-size: 8pt; border-left-style: none; overflow: visible; padding-top: 0px"&gt;&lt;span style="color: #606060" id="lnum3"&gt;   3:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #0000ff"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #0000ff"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; ApplicationName { get; set; }&lt;/pre&gt;  &lt;!--CRLF--&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The first issue I came across had to do with Entity Framework.&#160; I can't add these annotations to the generated code from EF.&#160; The next time I edited my model, my annotations would be overwritten.&#160; So following &lt;a title="Scott Gu&#39;s Entity Framework Validation" href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2010/01/15/asp-net-mvc-2-model-validation.aspx"&gt;Scott Gu's example&lt;/a&gt;, I created a buddy class.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;div id="codeSnippetWrapper"&gt;    &lt;div style="border-bottom-style: none; text-align: left; padding-bottom: 0px; line-height: 12pt; border-right-style: none; background-color: #f4f4f4; padding-left: 0px;

 &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;p&gt;So now, this will tell MVC that when it checks the validation on the Application object, it should check these rules.&#160; So everything should work fine right?&#160;&#160; It didn't.&#160; For some reason, my validation was never being hit.&#160; I scoured the web.&#160; I ended up trying to add a ValidationAttribute and a DataAnnotationsModelValidator (as &lt;a title="Phil Haack and MVC2 Custom Validation" href="http://haacked.com/archive/2009/11/19/aspnetmvc2-custom-validation.aspx"&gt;described by Phil Haack here&lt;/a&gt;).&#160; It was referewhen adding these that I started getting a compilation error saying that my reference to System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations was not correct.&#160; I was referencing the 3.6.0.0 version when the attribute and model validator required 3.5.0.0.&#160; The data annotations and the buddy class set up did not care at all which version of the DLL was referenced, hence there was nothing to indicate this might be an issue.&#160; After switching the DLL and commenting out the ValidationAttribute and DataAnnotationsModelValidator, my validation continued to work fine.&#160; So, if you run afoul of any issues with your validation working, be sure to check your version of System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.      &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><dsq:thread_identifier>MVC2---Adding-Data-Annotation-Validation-for-Entity-Framework-Entities</dsq:thread_identifier><wp:post_date_gmt>2010-04-07 09:54:00.000</wp:post_date_gmt><wp:comment_status>open</wp:comment_status><wp:comment><dsq:remote><dsq:id>12</dsq:id><dsq:avatar/></dsq:remote><wp:comment_id>146</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>AtomicInternet</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>atomicinternet@gmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://atomicinternet.homeip.net</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>12.165.188.130</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2010-04-12 06:24:28.567</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content>John is OOO for the next 2 weeks, our only holdout against MVC.

<item><title>re: MVC2 - Adding Data Annotation Validation for Entity Framework Entities</title><link>http://chrisrisner.com/MVC2-%E2%80%93-Adding-Data-Annotation-Validation-for-Entity-Framework-Entities</link><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 10px; display: inline" align="right" src="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/634062222138168483.jpg" /&gt; I was hoping to wait for .Net 4.0 to drop before I started making a real MVC2 work application but just got the opportunity to rewrite a smaller existing web project.&#160; MVC2 for .Net 3.5 seemed a logical choice.&#160; In addition to finally getting MVC2 into a project, I wanted to try messing around with Entity Framework.&#160; Being decently skilled with LINQ-to-SQL, getting some experience with it's successor, Entity Framework, seemed like a wise idea.&#160; After creating my models and adding some controllers and views.&#160; It was time to start testing out the new DataAnnotation validation.&#160; DataAnnotations allow you to place attributes on your entities' properties which handle making sure they are valid.&#160; So for example, if I had an ApplicationName property that I wanted to both require, and mandate that it was no longer than 50 characters, I could do the following:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div id="codeSnippetWrapper"&gt;   &lt;div style="border-bottom-style: none; text-align: left; padding-bottom: 0px; line-height: 12pt; border-right-style: none; background-color: #f4f4f4; padding-left: 0px; width: 100%; padding-right: 0px; font-family: &#39;Courier New&#39;, courier, monospace; direction: ltr; border-top-style: none; color: black; font-size: 8pt; border-left-style: none; overflow: visible; padding-top: 0px" id="codeSnippet"&gt;     &lt;pre style="border-bottom-style: none; text-align: left; padding-bottom: 0px; line-height: 12pt; border-right-style: none; background-color: white; margin: 0em; padding-left: 0px; width: 100%; padding-right: 0px; font-family: &#39;Courier New&#39;, courier, monospace; direction: ltr; border-top-style: none; color: black; font-size: 8pt; border-left-style: none; overflow: visible; padding-top: 0px"&gt;&lt;span style="color: #606060" id="lnum1"&gt;   1:&lt;/span&gt; [Required(ErrorMessage = &lt;span style="color: #006080"&gt;&quot;Application Name Required&quot;&lt;/span&gt;)]&lt;/pre&gt;  &lt;!--CRLF--&gt;        &lt;pre style="border-bottom-style: none; text-align: left; padding-bottom: 0px; line-height: 12pt; border-right-style: none; background-color: #f4f4f4; margin: 0em; padding-left: 0px; width: 100%; padding-right: 0px; font-family: &#39;Courier New&#39;, courier, monospace;

[StringLength(50, ErrorMessage = &lt;span style="color: #006080"&gt;&quot;Application name must be under 50 characters&quot;&lt;/span&gt;)]&lt;/pre&gt;  &lt;!--CRLF--&gt;        &lt;pre style="border-bottom-style: none;

&lt;span style="color: #0000ff"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #0000ff"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; ApplicationName { get; set; }&lt;/pre&gt;  &lt;!--CRLF--&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The first issue I came across had to do with Entity Framework.&#160; I can't add these annotations to the generated code from EF.&#160; The next time I edited my model, my annotations would be overwritten.&#160; So following &lt;a title="Scott Gu&#39;s Entity Framework Validation" href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2010/01/15/asp-net-mvc-2-model-validation.aspx"&gt;Scott Gu's example&lt;/a&gt;, I created a buddy class.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;p&gt;So now, this will tell MVC that when it checks the validation on the Application object, it should check these rules.&#160; So everything should work fine right?&#160;&#160; It didn't.&#160; For some reason, my validation was never being hit.&#160; I scoured the web.&#160; I ended up trying to add a ValidationAttribute and a DataAnnotationsModelValidator (as &lt;a title="Phil Haack and MVC2 Custom Validation" href="http://haacked.com/archive/2009/11/19/aspnetmvc2-custom-validation.aspx"&gt;described by Phil Haack here&lt;/a&gt;).&#160; It was referewhen adding these that I started getting a compilation error saying that my reference to System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations was not correct.&#160; I was referencing the 3.6.0.0 version when the attribute and model validator required 3.5.0.0.&#160; The data annotations and the buddy class set up did not care at all which version of the DLL was referenced, hence there was nothing to indicate this might be an issue.&#160; After switching the DLL and commenting out the ValidationAttribute and DataAnnotationsModelValidator, my validation continued to work fine.&#160; So, if you run afoul of any issues with your validation working, be sure to check your version of System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.      &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><dsq:thread_identifier>MVC2---Adding-Data-Annotation-Validation-for-Entity-Framework-Entities</dsq:thread_identifier><wp:post_date_gmt>2010-04-07 09:54:00.000</wp:post_date_gmt><wp:comment_status>open</wp:comment_status><wp:comment><dsq:remote><dsq:id>4</dsq:id><dsq:avatar/></dsq:remote><wp:comment_id>147</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Chris</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>chris@chrisrisner.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://chrisrisner.com</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>12.165.188.130</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2010-04-12 06:40:33.910</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content>Wait until they drop .net 4.0 later this week / today.

It didn't.&#160; For some reason, my validation was never being hit.&#160; I scoured the web.&#160; I ended up trying to add a ValidationAttribute and a DataAnnotationsModelValidator (as &lt;a title="Phil Haack and MVC2 Custom Validation" href="http://haacked.com/archive/2009/11/19/aspnetmvc2-custom-validation.aspx"&gt;described by Phil Haack here&lt;/a&gt;).&#160; It was referewhen adding these that I started getting a compilation error saying that my reference to System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations was not correct.&#160; I was referencing the 3.6.0.0 version when the attribute and model validator required 3.5.0.0.&#160; The data annotations and the buddy class set up did not care at all which version of the DLL was referenced, hence there was nothing to indicate this might be an issue.&#160; After switching the DLL and commenting out the ValidationAttribute and DataAnnotationsModelValidator, my validation continued to work fine.&#160; So, if you run afoul of any issues with your validation working, be sure to check your version of System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.      &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><dsq:thread_identifier>MVC2---Adding-Data-Annotation-Validation-for-Entity-Framework-Entities</dsq:thread_identifier><wp:post_date_gmt>2010-04-07 09:54:00.000</wp:post_date_gmt><wp:comment_status>open</wp:comment_status><wp:comment><dsq:remote><dsq:id>18</dsq:id><dsq:avatar/></dsq:remote><wp:comment_id>148</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Stavos</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>stavos@gmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://www.detroitarchive.com</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>165.215.94.12</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2010-04-13 07:21:46.090</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content>Waiting for you to get sued by Marval in 3...2...1</wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment></item>

Is there an issue with the mail server?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Their response was (paraphrased):&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you continue to experience a problem, please let us know the url of the page as well as the steps we can take to duplicate the issue.&#160; Also, here's how to take a screenshot.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While I understand that they have to offer support that both the slack jawed yokel and the software engineer can understand, no where in their response is there even a shred of an answer to the question I posed.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;My follow-up request:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;    &lt;p&gt;I guess I should clarify. I'm NOT getting an error sending an email through your web client or anything like that. I am sending emails through my asp.net web site using the goaddy relay server as specified here; &lt;a href="http://help.godaddy.com/article/955"&gt;http://help.godaddy.com/article/955&lt;/a&gt;. Up until the past couple of days, this worked fine. I have made NO code changes and DO NOT require code help.. I am NOT getting any errors when I try to email through r&lt;a href="http://elay-hosting.secureserver.net"&gt;elay-hosting.secureserver.net&lt;/a&gt; but it is not working. Can someone please check this out?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Their response (again paraphrased):&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We need to know how to reproduce this.&#160; Please give us more information.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While I was pretty sure I had specified EXACTLY how I was using their mail relay to send email through my asp.net web site, I'll give them a bone and try to be helpful.&#160; My next (we're on number 3 here) email explained how to get to my contact page and exactly what happened (again that it sent email through their relay server) when they used the form.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Their (3rd) response (paraphrased):&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What address are you expecting to receive this email on.&#160; We aren't showing any issues with our relay servers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It was at this point that I thought that maybe the emails were making it through and going to the spam folder.&#160; Sure enough, there they were.&#160; Every one had not passed the gmail or the Google Apps spam mail filter.&#160; With this in mind, I sent my 4th support request:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;    &lt;p&gt;After looking into this more on my side, I think that Google is blacklisting emails from &lt;a href="http://relay-hosting.secureserver.net"&gt;relay-hosting.secureserver.net&lt;/a&gt; If I send an email from any of my domains through &lt;a href="http://secureserver.net"&gt;secureserver.net&lt;/a&gt;'s relay, they are ending up in spam folders for gmail and google app accounts. I'm very certain it has to do with secureserver relaying the emails as when I send the emails through gmail or google apps (or any other relay I've tried using) they get to their destinations just fine. Just to stress this, the emails ONLY end up in the spam folders when sent through the secure server's relay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The important things here are that I'm stating that the emails going through their relay server are being marked as spam.&#160; However, if email is sent through the gmail (or google apps mail) interface, none of them are marked as spam.&#160; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;GoDaddy's 4th response:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;    &lt;p&gt;In case you are using a &quot;from&quot; address in your code with referring to our shared hosting email relay server, please confirm that you are not referring to a major free email provider such as Gmail as the &quot;from&quot; address, as this will most likely result in the emails being blocked.&#160;&#160; For testing / set-up purposes, we would recommend not referring t any free Web-based email service to confirm that you are referring to our email relay servers correctly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A fair point.&#160; The emails should show up as coming from my domain.&#160; Oh wait, they are.&#160; The emails were coming from either an address at this domain or an address at a different domain.&#160; Both hosted at GoDaddy, both sending emails through their relay.&#160; The important thing to remember here is that it wasn't just one domain I was having issues with.&#160; It was two separate domains.&#160; In my 5th response, I stated these things.&#160; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Their 5th response:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately we cannot control how emails are filtered by the recipient. Please note that our server admins work to keep our email servers off of block-lists. Since you do receive the messages it seems that we are not on their block-list. If you are receiving the messages in a spam, or bulk folder you will need to specify that the message is not spam to prevent this from happening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;First, I never asked them to do anything such as control how Google filter's their mail.&#160; Second, I never claimed the email servers were on a "block-list".&#160; For those of you not in the know, email providers, such as Google, use many different criteria when determining if an incoming email is spam.&#160; One of those ways is based off the "reputation" of the mail server it comes from.&#160; The idea being that as emails come through, if people say "this email is spam", that mail server's reputation goes down.&#160; Eventually it get's to a point where all emails coming from it are marked as spam by that email provider.&#160; If the mail server continues to offend, it's put on a "block-list" and emails just aren't let through at all.&#160; So while I never said the mail server was on a "block-list", I certainly wouldn't be insane thinking that maybe their mail server had been &lt;strong&gt;blacklisted&lt;/strong&gt; and the emails marked as spam.&#160; At this point, I was really just looking for them to at least own up to the possibility that their mail server's reputation was so bad, emails were getting sent directly to spam folders.&#160; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;My 6th, and final support communication:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Perhaps I am missing something that you can explain. Two separate domains that I have hosted through GoDaddy are both using GoDaddy's mail relay server. Suddenly, mail from both of these domains start failing Google's spam filter. However, when emails are sent via these email accounts (not using the relay server) they do not fail the spam filter. I think my assumption that there is an issue with the relay servers' email being marked as spam is solid. As it stands, I am unable to use a secure external relay due to port 587 being blocked. In addition, you seem unwilling or incapable of offering any real assistance. Can my ticket be escalated please?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So here, I'm laying my case out completely.&#160; Two different domains, both using the GoDaddy mail relay, have both started being sent directly to the spam folders of google mail accounts.&#160; Emails sent through these accounts NOT using the relay server (either through the mail interface or their smtp / imap clients) are not marked as spam.&#160; Furthermore, I can't switch to using gmail's SMTP mail relay to send my emails from my web site.&#160; Due to ports being blocked, GoDaddy's mail relay is my only option.&#160; At this point, I'm tired of dealing with people that can't answer any of my questions to any degree of satisfaction.&#160; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Their 6th response:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;    &lt;p&gt;As stated in our previous response, we cannot control how Google filters their mail. You will need to contact Google, or whitelist the emails to prevent them from being filtered as spam. We thank you for your understanding in this matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A complete failure to provide any assistance whatsoever.&#160; I did like that they said I could "whitelist" the emails despite a complete lack of explanation on why they might be "blackelisted" in the first place.&#160; As I can't switch to a different mail relay, as explained above, I don't really have any other options.&#160; I am currently in the process of examining alternative hosting solutions and have started recommending friends away from GoDaddy (two have already asked me questions leading to suggestions for alternate registrars and hosting solutions).&#160; I would rather start paying more for better service and actual options than continue with GoDaddy.&#160; (On a side note, GoDaddy might have 24 hour support, but when you state that there is a 2 hour wait for responses to email support questions and then take 4.5 hours to respond, your 24 hour support really doesn't mean shit).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;strong&gt;Update: 6/24/2010&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I've since moved all of my hosting off GoDaddy.

Deciding to just move from a TV to a projector wasn't exactly an easy one.&#160; I couldn't just move the TV out of a room and put the projector on a table in that room and call it a day.&#160; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To begin with, I wanted to put the projector on the middle floor (I have a tri-level) of my house.&#160; While this would have provided the widest viewing area, there would have been no way to contain and block the light in the room on the main floor.&#160; Outside of making the floor hideous with blackout curtains hanging everywhere, there wasn't a way to make it work.&#160; Much to Erin's pleasure, this meant I was back to putting the projector downstairs.&#160; Sadly this didn't eliminate all of my problems.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Wanting to stream a lot of video, wireless wasn't really an option.&#160; Unfortunately this meant I would need to run some network cable into the downstairs (to where the projector would be), to the main floor (where I would move the TV and Media Center), as well as into the bedroom so I could eventually stream to there.&#160; After ordering wire from &lt;a title="MonoPrice" href="http://www.monoprice.com"&gt;Monoprice&lt;/a&gt; I drilled some holes and climbed up into the attic.&#160; Running the wires ended up being almost too easy with the exception of one place.&#160; Downstairs, I needed to run the wires from the living room, into the ceiling, through a shaft about 6" tall (from the ceiling of bottom floor to the bottom of the top floor) and into the laundry room.&#160; I solved this problem by &lt;a title="Wire Hangers" href="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/proj-hanger.JPG"&gt;taping together about 8 wire hangers&lt;/a&gt; (after straightening them) and taping one wire to that hanger.&#160; After running that through the floorboards, I taped the &lt;a title="hanging wires" href="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/proj-hanging-wires.JPG"&gt;other 5 wires&lt;/a&gt; (I was running some speaker wire as well) to the wire that had already been run through and pulled them back to the &lt;a title="Wires in Laundry Room" href="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/proj-wires-laundry-room.JPG"&gt;laundry room&lt;/a&gt; where all my wires would meet.&#160; After this I just had to &lt;a title="Splice and Test Wires" href="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/proj-wires-brad.JPG"&gt;splice and test the wires&lt;/a&gt; I'd already &lt;a title="Wires in walls" href="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/proj-wires-wall-1.JPG"&gt;pulled through the walls&lt;/a&gt; to make sure they were working and then put some &lt;a title="Face Plates" href="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/proj-wires-plate.JPG"&gt;nice looking plates in front of them&lt;/a&gt;.&#160; The last step prior to mounting the projector was to &lt;a title="Move a light Switch" href="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/proj-moveswitch.JPG"&gt;move a light switch&lt;/a&gt; that would be right in the projector screens path on the wall downstairs.&#160; Despite having to cut our a gang box and having to connect and extend actual power lines, this step ended up being not too difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

If you were paying attention, you know that part 6 in our &lt;a title="Veritas Blog Engine" href="http://chrisrisner.com/Veritas--Creating-a-Blog-Engine-with-MVC-2-and--Net-4-0-%E2%80%93-Part-1"&gt;Veritas Blog Engine series&lt;/a&gt; was supposed to be about Error Logging.&#160; Well, we're going to go a bit out of order and do Data Access first.&#160; The reason for this is that we're going to use a lot of our data access methods in the sections I originally thought we'd write first.&#160; I ran into quite a bit of &lt;a title="Entity Framework 3.5" href="http://chrisrisner.com/MVC2-%E2%80%93-Adding-Data-Annotation-Validation-for-Entity-Framework-Entities"&gt;trouble the last time I played with Entity Framework&lt;/a&gt; when it was 3.5.&#160; Thankfully, they made quite a few improvements with 4.0 so we're going to give it another try.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a onclick="return hs.expand(this)" class="highslide" href="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/VeritasEDMX.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="border-right-width: 0px;

First things first, if you haven't already done so, add a Models folder to your DataLayer project.&#160; All of our database objects and any extensions will sit in this folder and namespace.&#160; After that, we'll add a "ADO .Net Entity Data Model" which is the Entity Framework file that we generate all of our database classes and connections in.&#160; Like every past version of Microsoft's "This is the way to do database access", we get to generate the majority of our code straight from the database.&#160; Included in this is the same functionality we had with the Linq2Sql generator for pluralizing / singularizing object names (though now it's optional) as well as including foreign key columns in the models (which will hopefully fix the FK problems that plagued 3.5 (seriously it was like they designed it to be hard to have foreign key constraints).&#160; Once we've selected all of our tables and tell it to generate we're given an EDMX file and presented with a fantastic database diagram view.&#160; Now, technically, we've generated our database access.&#160; We could call it a day.&#160; However, since we're using the &lt;a title="repository" href="http://chrisrisner.com/Veritas-%E2%80%93-Base-Objects-%E2%80%93-Part-5"&gt;repository pattern&lt;/a&gt; and we want all of our data access methods to be in one place, we'll go ahead and create all of those methods in the repository class we made in the last entry.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Before we can add any data access methods we need to add a instance of our Entities object (EDMX) to our repository like so:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class="csharpcode"&gt;   &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; VeritasBlogDBV3Entities db = &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; VeritasBlogDBV3Entities();&lt;/pre&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;style type="text/css"&gt;      .csharpcode, .csharpcode pre  {   font-size: small;   color: black;   font-family: consolas, "Courier New", courier, monospace;   background-color: #ffffff;   /*white-space: pre;*/  }  .csharpcode pre { margin: 0em; }  .csharpcode .rem { color: #008000; }  .csharpcode .kwrd { color: #0000ff; }  .csharpcode .str { color: #006080; }  .csharpcode .op { color: #0000c0; }  .csharpcode .preproc { color: #cc6633; }  .csharpcode .asp { background-color: #ffff00; }  .csharpcode .html { color: #800000; }  .csharpcode .attr { color: #ff0000; }  .csharpcode .alt   {   background-color: #f4f4f4;   width: 100%;   margin: 0em;  }  .csharpcode .lnum { color: #606060; }&lt;/style&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;So inside of our repository class we'll use db. to do all our database interaction.&#160; The first method we'll create is our Save method.&#160; This method handles saving any inserts, updates, and deletes after they're done:&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;div class="csharpcode"&gt;    &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   1:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="rem"&gt;/// &lt;summary&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   2:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="rem"&gt;/// Saves all DB changes and then accepts the changes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   3:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="rem"&gt;/// &lt;/summary&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   4:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; Save()&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   5:  &lt;/span&gt;{&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   6:  &lt;/span&gt;    db.SaveChanges(System.Data.Objects.SaveOptions.AcceptAllChangesAfterSave);&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   7:  &lt;/span&gt;}&lt;/pre&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;style type="text/css"&gt;      .csharpcode, .csharpcode pre  {   font-size: small;   color: black;   font-family: consolas, "Courier New", courier, monospace;   background-color: #ffffff;   /*white-space: pre;*/  }  .csharpcode pre { margin: 0em; }  .csharpcode .rem { color: #008000; }  .csharpcode .kwrd { color: #0000ff; }  .csharpcode .str { color: #006080; }  .csharpcode .op { color: #0000c0; }  .csharpcode .preproc { color: #cc6633; }  .csharpcode .asp { background-color: #ffff00; }  .csharpcode .html { color: #800000; }  .csharpcode .attr { color: #ff0000; }  .csharpcode .alt   {   background-color: #f4f4f4;   width: 100%;   margin: 0em;  }  .csharpcode .lnum { color: #606060; }&lt;/style&gt;    &lt;p&gt;We'll call this method after doing any DB changes (or after any group of DB changes if we're not doing them individually).&#160; After this, we'll add entries (separated out into regions) for each of our objects for adding and deleting.&#160; So for example, here are the methods for the BlogConfig object:&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;div class="csharpcode"&gt;    &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   1:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="preproc"&gt;#region&lt;/span&gt; BlogConfig&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   2:  &lt;/span&gt;&#160;&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   3:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; Add(BlogConfig blogConfig)&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   4:  &lt;/span&gt;{&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   5:  &lt;/span&gt;    db.BlogConfigs.AddObject(blogConfig);&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   6:  &lt;/span&gt;}&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   7:  &lt;/span&gt;&#160;&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   8:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; Delete(BlogConfig blogConfig)&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   9:  &lt;/span&gt;{&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  10:  &lt;/span&gt;    db.BlogConfigs.DeleteObject(blogConfig);&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  11:  &lt;/span&gt;}&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  12:  &lt;/span&gt;&#160;&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  13:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="preproc"&gt;#endregion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;style type="text/css"&gt;      .csharpcode, .csharpcode pre  {   font-size: small;   color: black;   font-family: consolas, "Courier New", courier, monospace;   background-color: #ffffff;   /*white-space: pre;*/  }  .csharpcode pre { margin: 0em; }  .csharpcode .rem { color: #008000; }  .csharpcode .kwrd { color: #0000ff; }  .csharpcode .str { color: #006080; }  .csharpcode .op { color: #0000c0; }  .csharpcode .preproc { color: #cc6633; }  .csharpcode .asp { background-color: #ffff00; }  .csharpcode .html { color: #800000; }  .csharpcode .attr { color: #ff0000; }  .csharpcode .alt   {   background-color: #f4f4f4;   width: 100%;   margin: 0em;  }  .csharpcode .lnum { color: #606060; }&lt;/style&gt;    &lt;p&gt;These are pretty simple methods and just handle telling our entity object that we want to insert or delete something.&#160; The Save method still has to be called after each of these.&#160; A quick note on the delete methods:&#160; we may or may not end up ever using them.&#160; Typically I don't like deleting data as much as "marking it inactive" for historical purposes.&#160; We're going to write some unit tests in a second so we're going to write a method to pull all our BlogConfigs from the DB.&#160; We won't end up using this anywhere but in our unit test.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;div class="csharpcode"&gt;    &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   1:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; IEnumerable&lt;BlogConfig&gt; GetAllBlogConfigs()&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   2:  &lt;/span&gt;{&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   3:  &lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; db.BlogConfigs;&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   4:  &lt;/span&gt;}&lt;/pre&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;style type="text/css"&gt;      .csharpcode, .csharpcode pre  {   font-size: small;   color: black;   font-family: consolas, "Courier New", courier, monospace;   background-color: #ffffff;   /*white-space: pre;*/  }  .csharpcode pre { margin: 0em; }  .csharpcode .rem { color: #008000; }  .csharpcode .kwrd { color: #0000ff; }  .csharpcode .str { color: #006080; }  .csharpcode .op { color: #0000c0; }  .csharpcode .preproc { color: #cc6633; }  .csharpcode .asp { background-color: #ffff00; }  .csharpcode .html { color: #800000; }  .csharpcode .attr { color: #ff0000; }  .csharpcode .alt   {   background-color: #f4f4f4;   width: 100%;   margin: 0em;  }  .csharpcode .lnum { color: #606060; }&lt;/style&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Now, before we can actually write some unit tests, we need to implement the StartTransaction and RollbackTransaction methods we made in the last entry.&#160; These methods will be called before and after any unit tests so we're not actually putting anything in the database.&#160; &lt;/p&gt;    &lt;div class="csharpcode"&gt;    &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   1:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; DbTransaction Transaction { get; set; }&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   2:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="rem"&gt;/// &lt;summary&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   3:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="rem"&gt;/// Will create a new transation.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   4:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="rem"&gt;/// &lt;/summary&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   5:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; StartTransaction()&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   6:  &lt;/span&gt;{&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   7:  &lt;/span&gt;    db.Connection.Open();&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   8:  &lt;/span&gt;    DbTransaction trans = db.Connection.BeginTransaction();&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   9:  &lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;.Transaction = trans;&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  10:  &lt;/span&gt;}&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  11:  &lt;/span&gt;&#160;&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  12:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="rem"&gt;/// &lt;summary&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  13:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="rem"&gt;/// Rolls back a transation. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  14:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="rem"&gt;/// &lt;/summary&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  15:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; RollbackTransaction()&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  16:  &lt;/span&gt;{&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  17:  &lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;.Transaction.Rollback();&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  18:  &lt;/span&gt;}&lt;/pre&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;style type="text/css"&gt;      .csharpcode, .csharpcode pre  {   font-size: small;   color: black;   font-family: consolas, "Courier New", courier, monospace;

   &lt;div class="csharpcode"&gt;    &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   1:  &lt;/span&gt;[TestClass()]&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   2:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt;

When the test is done, it will call the RollbackTransaction method on the repo.&#160; If everything goes well, it will create a new config object, insert it into the database, save that change, pull it back, and make sure it comes back from the DB.&#160; Since most of our tests (such as our DeleteConfig test) will rely on having a BlogConfig and a BlogUser (if not many more things) to already be in the DB, we'll eventually insert all of these in the test initialize but for now, we can add all of our Add / Delete methods and create tests for them.&#160; Since we need to be able to pull records back from the database to make sure our tests are working, we'll need to add more methods like the GetAllBlogConfigs seen above.&#160; There are a lot of methods that we'll in our repository that we're not going to list here so if you want to see them all, download the files and check out the repo.&#160; As of now, we've got what should be all the data access methods we'll need as well as the unit tests for all of them.&#160; As always, you can &lt;a title="Veritas Part 6" href="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/Veritas Part 6.zip"&gt;download the latest here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><dsq:thread_identifier>Veritas---Data-Access-with-Entity-Framework-4-0---Part-6</dsq:thread_identifier><wp:post_date_gmt>2010-07-12 22:51:00.000</wp:post_date_gmt><wp:comment_status>open</wp:comment_status><wp:comment><dsq:remote><dsq:id>18</dsq:id><dsq:avatar/></dsq:remote><wp:comment_id>154</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Stavos</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>stavos@gmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://www.detroitarchive.com</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>165.215.94.12</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2010-07-14 15:01:32.653</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content>Where did all the fun go at this site?

If you were paying attention, you know that part 6 in our &lt;a title="Veritas Blog Engine" href="http://chrisrisner.com/Veritas--Creating-a-Blog-Engine-with-MVC-2-and--Net-4-0-%E2%80%93-Part-1"&gt;Veritas Blog Engine series&lt;/a&gt; was supposed to be about Error Logging.&#160; Well, we're going to go a bit out of order and do Data Access first.&#160; The reason for this is that we're going to use a lot of our data access methods in the sections I originally thought we'd write first.&#160; I ran into quite a bit of &lt;a title="Entity Framework 3.5" href="http://chrisrisner.com/MVC2-%E2%80%93-Adding-Data-Annotation-Validation-for-Entity-Framework-Entities"&gt;trouble the last time I played with Entity Framework&lt;/a&gt; when it was 3.5.&#160; Thankfully, they made quite a few improvements with 4.0 so we're going to give it another try.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a onclick="return hs.expand(this)" class="highslide" href="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/VeritasEDMX.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="border-right-width: 0px; margin: 0px 10px 0px 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="Veritas EDMX" border="0" alt="Veritas EDMX" align="left" src="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/VeritasEDMX.jpg" width="239" height="244" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; First things first, if you haven't already done so, add a Models folder to your DataLayer project.&#160; All of our database objects and any extensions will sit in this folder and namespace.&#160; After that, we'll add a "ADO .Net Entity Data Model" which is the Entity Framework file that we generate all of our database classes and connections in.&#160; Like every past version of Microsoft's "This is the way to do database access", we get to generate the majority of our code straight from the database.&#160; Included in this is the same functionality we had with the Linq2Sql generator for pluralizing / singularizing object names (though now it's optional) as well as including foreign key columns in the models (which will hopefully fix the FK problems that plagued 3.5 (seriously it was like they designed it to be hard to have foreign key constraints).&#160; Once we've selected all of our tables and tell it to generate we're given an EDMX file and presented with a fantastic database diagram view.&#160; Now, technically, we've generated our database access.&#160; We could call it a day.&#160; However, since we're using the &lt;a title="repository" href="http://chrisrisner.com/Veritas-%E2%80%93-Base-Objects-%E2%80%93-Part-5"&gt;repository pattern&lt;/a&gt; and we want all of our data access methods to be in one place, we'll go ahead and create all of those methods in the repository class we made in the last entry.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Before we can add any data access methods we need to add a instance of our Entities object (EDMX) to our repository like so:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class="csharpcode"&gt;   &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; VeritasBlogDBV3Entities db = &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; VeritasBlogDBV3Entities();&lt;/pre&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;style type="text/css"&gt;      .csharpcode, .csharpcode pre  {   font-size: small;   color: black;   font-family: consolas, "Courier New", courier, monospace;   background-color: #ffffff;   /*white-space: pre;*/  }  .csharpcode pre { margin: 0em; }  .csharpcode .rem { color: #008000; }  .csharpcode .kwrd { color: #0000ff; }  .csharpcode .str { color: #006080; }  .csharpcode .op { color: #0000c0; }  .csharpcode .preproc { color: #cc6633; }  .csharpcode .asp { background-color: #ffff00; }  .csharpcode .html { color: #800000; }  .csharpcode .attr { color: #ff0000; }  .csharpcode .alt   {   background-color: #f4f4f4;   width: 100%;   margin: 0em;  }  .csharpcode .lnum { color: #606060; }&lt;/style&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;So inside of our repository class we'll use db. to do all our database interaction.&#160; The first method we'll create is our Save method.&#160; This method handles saving any inserts, updates, and deletes after they're done:&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;div class="csharpcode"&gt;    &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   1:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="rem"&gt;/// &lt;summary&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   2:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="rem"&gt;/// Saves all DB changes and then accepts the changes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   3:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="rem"&gt;/// &lt;/summary&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   4:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; Save()&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   5:  &lt;/span&gt;{&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   6:  &lt;/span&gt;    db.SaveChanges(System.Data.Objects.SaveOptions.AcceptAllChangesAfterSave);&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   7:  &lt;/span&gt;}&lt;/pre&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;style type="text/css"&gt;      .csharpcode, .csharpcode pre  {   font-size: small;   color: black;   font-family: consolas, "Courier New", courier, monospace;   background-color: #ffffff;   /*white-space: pre;*/  }  .csharpcode pre { margin: 0em; }  .csharpcode .rem { color: #008000; }  .csharpcode .kwrd { color: #0000ff; }  .csharpcode .str { color: #006080; }  .csharpcode .op { color: #0000c0; }  .csharpcode .preproc { color: #cc6633; }  .csharpcode .asp { background-color: #ffff00; }  .csharpcode .html { color: #800000; }  .csharpcode .attr { color: #ff0000; }  .csharpcode .alt   {   background-color: #f4f4f4;   width: 100%;   margin: 0em;  }  .csharpcode .lnum { color: #606060; }&lt;/style&gt;    &lt;p&gt;We'll call this method after doing any DB changes (or after any group of DB changes if we're not doing them individually).&#160; After this, we'll add entries (separated out into regions) for each of our objects for adding and deleting.&#160; So for example, here are the methods for the BlogConfig object:&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;div class="csharpcode"&gt;    &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   1:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="preproc"&gt;#region&lt;/span&gt; BlogConfig&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   2:  &lt;/span&gt;&#160;&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   3:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; Add(BlogConfig blogConfig)&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   4:  &lt;/span&gt;{&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   5:  &lt;/span&gt;    db.BlogConfigs.AddObject(blogConfig);&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   6:  &lt;/span&gt;}&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   7:  &lt;/span&gt;&#160;&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   8:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; Delete(BlogConfig blogConfig)&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   9:  &lt;/span&gt;{&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  10:  &lt;/span&gt;    db.BlogConfigs.DeleteObject(blogConfig);&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  11:  &lt;/span&gt;}&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  12:  &lt;/span&gt;&#160;&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  13:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="preproc"&gt;#endregion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;style type="text/css"&gt;      .csharpcode, .csharpcode pre  {   font-size: small;   color: black;   font-family: consolas, "Courier New", courier, monospace;   background-color: #ffffff;   /*white-space: pre;*/  }  .csharpcode pre { margin: 0em; }  .csharpcode .rem { color: #008000; }  .csharpcode .kwrd { color: #0000ff; }  .csharpcode .str { color: #006080; }  .csharpcode .op { color: #0000c0; }  .csharpcode .preproc { color: #cc6633; }  .csharpcode .asp { background-color: #ffff00; }  .csharpcode .html { color: #800000; }  .csharpcode .attr { color: #ff0000; }  .csharpcode .alt   {   background-color: #f4f4f4;   width: 100%;   margin: 0em;  }  .csharpcode .lnum { color: #606060; }&lt;/style&gt;    &lt;p&gt;These are pretty simple methods and just handle telling our entity object that we want to insert or delete something.&#160; The Save method still has to be called after each of these.&#160; A quick note on the delete methods:&#160; we may or may not end up ever using them.&#160; Typically I don't like deleting data as much as "marking it inactive" for historical purposes.&#160; We're going to write some unit tests in a second so we're going to write a method to pull all our BlogConfigs from the DB.&#160; We won't end up using this anywhere but in our unit test.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;div class="csharpcode"&gt;    &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   1:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; IEnumerable&lt;BlogConfig&gt; GetAllBlogConfigs()&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   2:  &lt;/span&gt;{&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   3:  &lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; db.BlogConfigs;&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   4:  &lt;/span&gt;}&lt;/pre&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;style type="text/css"&gt;      .csharpcode, .csharpcode pre  {   font-size: small;   color: black;   font-family: consolas, "Courier New", courier, monospace;   background-color: #ffffff;   /*white-space: pre;*/  }  .csharpcode pre { margin: 0em; }  .csharpcode .rem { color: #008000; }  .csharpcode .kwrd { color: #0000ff; }  .csharpcode .str { color: #006080; }  .csharpcode .op { color: #0000c0; }  .csharpcode .preproc { color: #cc6633; }  .csharpcode .asp { background-color: #ffff00; }  .csharpcode .html { color: #800000; }  .csharpcode .attr { color: #ff0000; }  .csharpcode .alt   {   background-color: #f4f4f4;   width: 100%;   margin: 0em;  }  .csharpcode .lnum { color: #606060; }&lt;/style&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Now, before we can actually write some unit tests, we need to implement the StartTransaction and RollbackTransaction methods we made in the last entry.&#160; These methods will be called before and after any unit tests so we're not actually putting anything in the database.&#160; &lt;/p&gt;    &lt;div class="csharpcode"&gt;    &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   1:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; DbTransaction Transaction { get; set; }&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   2:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="rem"&gt;/// &lt;summary&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   3:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="rem"&gt;/// Will create a new transation.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   4:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="rem"&gt;/// &lt;/summary&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   5:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; StartTransaction()&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   6:  &lt;/span&gt;{&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   7:  &lt;/span&gt;    db.Connection.Open();&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   8:  &lt;/span&gt;    DbTransaction trans = db.Connection.BeginTransaction();&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   9:  &lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;.Transaction = trans;&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  10:  &lt;/span&gt;}&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  11:  &lt;/span&gt;&#160;&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  12:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="rem"&gt;/// &lt;summary&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  13:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="rem"&gt;/// Rolls back a transation. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  14:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="rem"&gt;/// &lt;/summary&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  15:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; RollbackTransaction()&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  16:  &lt;/span&gt;{&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  17:  &lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;.Transaction.Rollback();&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  18:  &lt;/span&gt;}&lt;/pre&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;style type="text/css"&gt;      .csharpcode, .csharpcode pre  {   font-size: small;   color: black;   font-family: consolas, "Courier New", courier, monospace;   background-color: #ffffff;   /*white-space: pre;*/  }  .csharpcode pre { margin: 0em; }  .csharpcode .rem { color: #008000; }  .csharpcode .kwrd { color: #0000ff; }  .csharpcode .str { color: #006080;

   &lt;div class="csharpcode"&gt;    &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   1:  &lt;/span&gt;[TestClass()]&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   2:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt;

 20:  &lt;/span&gt;}&lt;/pre&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;style type="text/css"&gt;      .csharpcode, .csharpcode pre  {   font-size: small;   color: black;   font-family: consolas, "Courier New", courier, monospace;

     &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  11:  &lt;/span&gt;        CreateDate = DateTime.Now,&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  12:  &lt;/span&gt;        ConfigXml = &lt;span class="str"&gt;&quot;&lt;BlogConfig&gt;&lt;/BlogConfig&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  13:  &lt;/span&gt;    };&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  14:  &lt;/span&gt;    repo.Add(blogConfig);&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;

 17:  &lt;/span&gt;    var configs = repo.GetAllBlogConfigs().ToArray();&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  18:  &lt;/span&gt;    var testConfig = configs.Where(p =&gt; p.Host == &lt;span class="str"&gt;&quot;test.com&quot;&lt;/span&gt;).SingleOrDefault();&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  19:  &lt;/span&gt;    Assert.IsNotNull(testConfig);            &lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  20:  &lt;/span&gt;}&lt;/pre&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;style type="text/css"&gt;      .csharpcode, .csharpcode pre  {   font-size: small;   color: black;   font-family: consolas, "Courier New", courier, monospace;   background-color: #ffffff;   /*white-space: pre;*/  }  .csharpcode pre { margin: 0em; }  .csharpcode .rem { color: #008000; }  .csharpcode .kwrd { color: #0000ff; }  .csharpcode .str { color: #006080; }  .csharpcode .op { color: #0000c0;

When the test is done, it will call the RollbackTransaction method on the repo.&#160; If everything goes well, it will create a new config object, insert it into the database, save that change, pull it back, and make sure it comes back from the DB.&#160; Since most of our tests (such as our DeleteConfig test) will rely on having a BlogConfig and a BlogUser (if not many more things) to already be in the DB, we'll eventually insert all of these in the test initialize but for now, we can add all of our Add / Delete methods and create tests for them.&#160; Since we need to be able to pull records back from the database to make sure our tests are working, we'll need to add more methods like the GetAllBlogConfigs seen above.&#160; There are a lot of methods that we'll in our repository that we're not going to list here so if you want to see them all, download the files and check out the repo.&#160; As of now, we've got what should be all the data access methods we'll need as well as the unit tests for all of them.&#160; As always, you can &lt;a title="Veritas Part 6" href="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/Veritas Part 6.zip"&gt;download the latest here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><dsq:thread_identifier>Veritas---Data-Access-with-Entity-Framework-4-0---Part-6</dsq:thread_identifier><wp:post_date_gmt>2010-07-12 22:51:00.000</wp:post_date_gmt><wp:comment_status>open</wp:comment_status><wp:comment><dsq:remote><dsq:id>4</dsq:id><dsq:avatar/></dsq:remote><wp:comment_id>155</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Chris</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>chris@chrisrisner.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://chrisrisner.com</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>71.65.4.130</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2010-07-20 20:09:29.870</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content>Sorry Stavos.

If you were paying attention, you know that part 6 in our &lt;a title="Veritas Blog Engine" href="http://chrisrisner.com/Veritas--Creating-a-Blog-Engine-with-MVC-2-and--Net-4-0-%E2%80%93-Part-1"&gt;Veritas Blog Engine series&lt;/a&gt; was supposed to be about Error Logging.&#160; Well, we're going to go a bit out of order and do Data Access first.&#160; The reason for this is that we're going to use a lot of our data access methods in the sections I originally thought we'd write first.&#160; I ran into quite a bit of &lt;a title="Entity Framework 3.5" href="http://chrisrisner.com/MVC2-%E2%80%93-Adding-Data-Annotation-Validation-for-Entity-Framework-Entities"&gt;trouble the last time I played with Entity Framework&lt;/a&gt; when it was 3.5.&#160; Thankfully, they made quite a few improvements with 4.0 so we're going to give it another try.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a onclick="return hs.expand(this)" class="highslide" href="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/VeritasEDMX.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="border-right-width: 0px; margin: 0px 10px 0px 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="Veritas EDMX" border="0" alt="Veritas EDMX" align="left" src="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/VeritasEDMX.jpg" width="239" height="244" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; First things first, if you haven't already done so, add a Models folder to your DataLayer project.&#160; All of our database objects and any extensions will sit in this folder and namespace.&#160; After that, we'll add a "ADO .Net Entity Data Model" which is the Entity Framework file that we generate all of our database classes and connections in.&#160; Like every past version of Microsoft's "This is the way to do database access", we get to generate the majority of our code straight from the database.&#160; Included in this is the same functionality we had with the Linq2Sql generator for pluralizing / singularizing object names (though now it's optional) as well as including foreign key columns in the models (which will hopefully fix the FK problems that plagued 3.5 (seriously it was like they designed it to be hard to have foreign key constraints).&#160; Once we've selected all of our tables and tell it to generate we're given an EDMX file and presented with a fantastic database diagram view.&#160; Now, technically, we've generated our database access.&#160; We could call it a day.&#160; However, since we're using the &lt;a title="repository" href="http://chrisrisner.com/Veritas-%E2%80%93-Base-Objects-%E2%80%93-Part-5"&gt;repository pattern&lt;/a&gt; and we want all of our data access methods to be in one place, we'll go ahead and create all of those methods in the repository class we made in the last entry.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Before we can add any data access methods we need to add a instance of our Entities object (EDMX) to our repository like so:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class="csharpcode"&gt;   &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; VeritasBlogDBV3Entities db = &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; VeritasBlogDBV3Entities();&lt;/pre&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;style type="text/css"&gt;      .csharpcode, .csharpcode pre  {   font-size: small;   color: black;   font-family: consolas, "Courier New", courier, monospace;   background-color: #ffffff;   /*white-space: pre;*/  }  .csharpcode pre { margin: 0em; }  .csharpcode .rem { color: #008000; }  .csharpcode .kwrd { color: #0000ff; }  .csharpcode .str { color: #006080; }  .csharpcode .op { color: #0000c0; }  .csharpcode .preproc { color: #cc6633; }  .csharpcode .asp { background-color: #ffff00; }  .csharpcode .html { color: #800000; }  .csharpcode .attr { color: #ff0000; }  .csharpcode .alt   {   background-color: #f4f4f4;   width: 100%;   margin: 0em;  }  .csharpcode .lnum { color: #606060; }&lt;/style&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;So inside of our repository class we'll use db. to do all our database interaction.&#160; The first method we'll create is our Save method.&#160; This method handles saving any inserts, updates, and deletes after they're done:&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;div class="csharpcode"&gt;    &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   1:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="rem"&gt;/// &lt;summary&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   2:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="rem"&gt;/// Saves all DB changes and then accepts the changes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   3:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="rem"&gt;/// &lt;/summary&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   4:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; Save()&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   5:  &lt;/span&gt;{&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   6:  &lt;/span&gt;    db.SaveChanges(System.Data.Objects.SaveOptions.AcceptAllChangesAfterSave);&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   7:  &lt;/span&gt;}&lt;/pre&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;style type="text/css"&gt;      .csharpcode, .csharpcode pre  {   font-size: small;   color: black;   font-family: consolas, "Courier New", courier, monospace;   background-color: #ffffff;   /*white-space: pre;*/  }  .csharpcode pre { margin: 0em; }  .csharpcode .rem { color: #008000; }  .csharpcode .kwrd { color: #0000ff; }  .csharpcode .str { color: #006080; }  .csharpcode .op { color: #0000c0; }  .csharpcode .preproc { color: #cc6633; }  .csharpcode .asp { background-color: #ffff00; }  .csharpcode .html { color: #800000; }  .csharpcode .attr { color: #ff0000; }  .csharpcode .alt   {   background-color: #f4f4f4;   width: 100%;   margin: 0em;  }  .csharpcode .lnum { color: #606060; }&lt;/style&gt;    &lt;p&gt;We'll call this method after doing any DB changes (or after any group of DB changes if we're not doing them individually).&#160; After this, we'll add entries (separated out into regions) for each of our objects for adding and deleting.&#160; So for example, here are the methods for the BlogConfig object:&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;div class="csharpcode"&gt;    &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   1:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="preproc"&gt;#region&lt;/span&gt; BlogConfig&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   2:  &lt;/span&gt;&#160;&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   3:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; Add(BlogConfig blogConfig)&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   4:  &lt;/span&gt;{&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   5:  &lt;/span&gt;    db.BlogConfigs.AddObject(blogConfig);&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   6:  &lt;/span&gt;}&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   7:  &lt;/span&gt;&#160;&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   8:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; Delete(BlogConfig blogConfig)&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   9:  &lt;/span&gt;{&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  10:  &lt;/span&gt;    db.BlogConfigs.DeleteObject(blogConfig);&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  11:  &lt;/span&gt;}&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  12:  &lt;/span&gt;&#160;&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  13:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="preproc"&gt;#endregion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;style type="text/css"&gt;      .csharpcode, .csharpcode pre  {   font-size: small;   color: black;   font-family: consolas, "Courier New", courier, monospace;   background-color: #ffffff;   /*white-space: pre;*/  }  .csharpcode pre { margin: 0em; }  .csharpcode .rem { color: #008000; }  .csharpcode .kwrd { color: #0000ff; }  .csharpcode .str { color: #006080; }  .csharpcode .op { color: #0000c0; }  .csharpcode .preproc { color: #cc6633; }  .csharpcode .asp { background-color: #ffff00; }  .csharpcode .html { color: #800000; }  .csharpcode .attr { color: #ff0000; }  .csharpcode .alt   {   background-color: #f4f4f4;   width: 100%;   margin: 0em;  }  .csharpcode .lnum { color: #606060; }&lt;/style&gt;    &lt;p&gt;These are pretty simple methods and just handle telling our entity object that we want to insert or delete something.&#160; The Save method still has to be called after each of these.&#160; A quick note on the delete methods:&#160; we may or may not end up ever using them.&#160; Typically I don't like deleting data as much as "marking it inactive" for historical purposes.&#160; We're going to write some unit tests in a second so we're going to write a method to pull all our BlogConfigs from the DB.&#160; We won't end up using this anywhere but in our unit test.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;div class="csharpcode"&gt;    &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   1:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; IEnumerable&lt;BlogConfig&gt; GetAllBlogConfigs()&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   2:  &lt;/span&gt;{&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   3:  &lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; db.BlogConfigs;&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   4:  &lt;/span&gt;}&lt;/pre&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;style type="text/css"&gt;      .csharpcode, .csharpcode pre  {   font-size: small;   color: black;   font-family: consolas, "Courier New", courier, monospace;   background-color: #ffffff;   /*white-space: pre;*/  }  .csharpcode pre { margin: 0em; }  .csharpcode .rem { color: #008000; }  .csharpcode .kwrd { color: #0000ff; }  .csharpcode .str { color: #006080; }  .csharpcode .op { color: #0000c0; }  .csharpcode .preproc { color: #cc6633; }  .csharpcode .asp { background-color: #ffff00; }  .csharpcode .html { color: #800000; }  .csharpcode .attr { color: #ff0000; }  .csharpcode .alt   {   background-color: #f4f4f4;   width: 100%;   margin: 0em;  }  .csharpcode .lnum { color: #606060; }&lt;/style&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Now, before we can actually write some unit tests, we need to implement the StartTransaction and RollbackTransaction methods we made in the last entry.&#160; These methods will be called before and after any unit tests so we're not actually putting anything in the database.&#160; &lt;/p&gt;    &lt;div class="csharpcode"&gt;    &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   1:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; DbTransaction Transaction { get; set; }&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   2:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="rem"&gt;/// &lt;summary&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   3:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="rem"&gt;/// Will create a new transation.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   4:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="rem"&gt;/// &lt;/summary&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   5:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; StartTransaction()&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   6:  &lt;/span&gt;{&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   7:  &lt;/span&gt;    db.Connection.Open();&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   8:  &lt;/span&gt;    DbTransaction trans = db.Connection.BeginTransaction();&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;

     &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  19:  &lt;/span&gt;    Assert.IsNotNull(testConfig);            &lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  20:  &lt;/span&gt;}&lt;/pre&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;style type="text/css"&gt;      .csharpcode, .csharpcode pre  {   font-size: small;   color: black;   font-family: consolas, "Courier New", courier, monospace;   background-color: #ffffff;

When the test is done, it will call the RollbackTransaction method on the repo.&#160; If everything goes well, it will create a new config object, insert it into the database, save that change, pull it back, and make sure it comes back from the DB.&#160; Since most of our tests (such as our DeleteConfig test) will rely on having a BlogConfig and a BlogUser (if not many more things) to already be in the DB, we'll eventually insert all of these in the test initialize but for now, we can add all of our Add / Delete methods and create tests for them.&#160; Since we need to be able to pull records back from the database to make sure our tests are working, we'll need to add more methods like the GetAllBlogConfigs seen above.&#160; There are a lot of methods that we'll in our repository that we're not going to list here so if you want to see them all, download the files and check out the repo.&#160; As of now, we've got what should be all the data access methods we'll need as well as the unit tests for all of them.&#160; As always, you can &lt;a title="Veritas Part 6" href="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/Veritas Part 6.zip"&gt;download the latest here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><dsq:thread_identifier>Veritas---Data-Access-with-Entity-Framework-4-0---Part-6</dsq:thread_identifier><wp:post_date_gmt>2010-07-12 22:51:00.000</wp:post_date_gmt><wp:comment_status>open</wp:comment_status><wp:comment><dsq:remote><dsq:id>18</dsq:id><dsq:avatar/></dsq:remote><wp:comment_id>156</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Stavos</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>stavos@gmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://www.detroitarchive.com</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>67.149.68.187</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2010-07-20 20:47:01.303</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content>You suck well, don't worry i'm hard on all my friends, I just want them to work hard, I really do enjoy your blogs/rants/storys.</wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment></item>

Is there an issue with the mail server?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Their response was (paraphrased):&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you continue to experience a problem, please let us know the url of the page as well as the steps we can take to duplicate the issue.&#160; Also, here's how to take a screenshot.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While I understand that they have to offer support that both the slack jawed yokel and the software engineer can understand, no where in their response is there even a shred of an answer to the question I posed.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;My follow-up request:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;    &lt;p&gt;I guess I should clarify. I'm NOT getting an error sending an email through your web client or anything like that. I am sending emails through my asp.net web site using the goaddy relay server as specified here; &lt;a href="http://help.godaddy.com/article/955"&gt;http://help.godaddy.com/article/955&lt;/a&gt;. Up until the past couple of days, this worked fine. I have made NO code changes and DO NOT require code help.. I am NOT getting any errors when I try to email through r&lt;a href="http://elay-hosting.secureserver.net"&gt;elay-hosting.secureserver.net&lt;/a&gt; but it is not working. Can someone please check this out?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Their response (again paraphrased):&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We need to know how to reproduce this.&#160; Please give us more information.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While I was pretty sure I had specified EXACTLY how I was using their mail relay to send email through my asp.net web site, I'll give them a bone and try to be helpful.&#160; My next (we're on number 3 here) email explained how to get to my contact page and exactly what happened (again that it sent email through their relay server) when they used the form.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Their (3rd) response (paraphrased):&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What address are you expecting to receive this email on.&#160; We aren't showing any issues with our relay servers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It was at this point that I thought that maybe the emails were making it through and going to the spam folder.&#160; Sure enough, there they were.&#160; Every one had not passed the gmail or the Google Apps spam mail filter.&#160; With this in mind, I sent my 4th support request:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;    &lt;p&gt;After looking into this more on my side, I think that Google is blacklisting emails from &lt;a href="http://relay-hosting.secureserver.net"&gt;relay-hosting.secureserver.net&lt;/a&gt; If I send an email from any of my domains through &lt;a href="http://secureserver.net"&gt;secureserver.net&lt;/a&gt;'s relay, they are ending up in spam folders for gmail and google app accounts. I'm very certain it has to do with secureserver relaying the emails as when I send the emails through gmail or google apps (or any other relay I've tried using) they get to their destinations just fine. Just to stress this, the emails ONLY end up in the spam folders when sent through the secure server's relay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The important things here are that I'm stating that the emails going through their relay server are being marked as spam.&#160; However, if email is sent through the gmail (or google apps mail) interface, none of them are marked as spam.&#160; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;GoDaddy's 4th response:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;    &lt;p&gt;In case you are using a &quot;from&quot; address in your code with referring to our shared hosting email relay server, please confirm that you are not referring to a major free email provider such as Gmail as the &quot;from&quot; address, as this will most likely result in the emails being blocked.&#160;&#160; For testing / set-up purposes, we would recommend not referring t any free Web-based email service to confirm that you are referring to our email relay servers correctly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A fair point.&#160; The emails should show up as coming from my domain.&#160; Oh wait, they are.&#160; The emails were coming from either an address at this domain or an address at a different domain.&#160; Both hosted at GoDaddy, both sending emails through their relay.&#160; The important thing to remember here is that it wasn't just one domain I was having issues with.&#160; It was two separate domains.&#160; In my 5th response, I stated these things.&#160; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Their 5th response:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately we cannot control how emails are filtered by the recipient. Please note that our server admins work to keep our email servers off of block-lists. Since you do receive the messages it seems that we are not on their block-list. If you are receiving the messages in a spam, or bulk folder you will need to specify that the message is not spam to prevent this from happening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;First, I never asked them to do anything such as control how Google filter's their mail.&#160; Second, I never claimed the email servers were on a "block-list".&#160; For those of you not in the know, email providers, such as Google, use many different criteria when determining if an incoming email is spam.&#160; One of those ways is based off the "reputation" of the mail server it comes from.&#160; The idea being that as emails come through, if people say "this email is spam", that mail server's reputation goes down.&#160; Eventually it get's to a point where all emails coming from it are marked as spam by that email provider.&#160; If the mail server continues to offend, it's put on a "block-list" and emails just aren't let through at all.&#160; So while I never said the mail server was on a "block-list", I certainly wouldn't be insane thinking that maybe their mail server had been &lt;strong&gt;blacklisted&lt;/strong&gt; and the emails marked as spam.&#160; At this point, I was really just looking for them to at least own up to the possibility that their mail server's reputation was so bad, emails were getting sent directly to spam folders.&#160; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;My 6th, and final support communication:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Perhaps I am missing something that you can explain. Two separate domains that I have hosted through GoDaddy are both using GoDaddy's mail relay server. Suddenly, mail from both of these domains start failing Google's spam filter. However, when emails are sent via these email accounts (not using the relay server) they do not fail the spam filter. I think my assumption that there is an issue with the relay servers' email being marked as spam is solid. As it stands, I am unable to use a secure external relay due to port 587 being blocked. In addition, you seem unwilling or incapable of offering any real assistance. Can my ticket be escalated please?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So here, I'm laying my case out completely.&#160; Two different domains, both using the GoDaddy mail relay, have both started being sent directly to the spam folders of google mail accounts.&#160; Emails sent through these accounts NOT using the relay server (either through the mail interface or their smtp / imap clients) are not marked as spam.&#160; Furthermore, I can't switch to using gmail's SMTP mail relay to send my emails from my web site.&#160; Due to ports being blocked, GoDaddy's mail relay is my only option.&#160; At this point, I'm tired of dealing with people that can't answer any of my questions to any degree of satisfaction.&#160; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Their 6th response:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;    &lt;p&gt;As stated in our previous response, we cannot control how Google filters their mail. You will need to contact Google, or whitelist the emails to prevent them from being filtered as spam. We thank you for your understanding in this matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A complete failure to provide any assistance whatsoever.&#160; I did like that they said I could "whitelist" the emails despite a complete lack of explanation on why they might be "blackelisted" in the first place.&#160; As I can't switch to a different mail relay, as explained above, I don't really have any other options.&#160; I am currently in the process of examining alternative hosting solutions and have started recommending friends away from GoDaddy (two have already asked me questions leading to suggestions for alternate registrars and hosting solutions).&#160; I would rather start paying more for better service and actual options than continue with GoDaddy.&#160; (On a side note, GoDaddy might have 24 hour support, but when you state that there is a 2 hour wait for responses to email support questions and then take 4.5 hours to respond, your 24 hour support really doesn't mean shit).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;strong&gt;Update: 6/24/2010&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I've since moved all of my hosting off GoDaddy.

We use them for everything, but now our clients are complaining that their emails are getting marked as spam because the recipients email servers subscribe to spam lists of blacklisted servers, and GoDaddy's is blacklisted. It's unfortunate because they are affordable, but it might be time to start looking elsewhere. It's a shame they seem unwilling to listen to the voice of their customers, a voice that seems to be growing.</wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment></item>

Is there an issue with the mail server?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Their response was (paraphrased):&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you continue to experience a problem, please let us know the url of the page as well as the steps we can take to duplicate the issue.&#160; Also, here's how to take a screenshot.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While I understand that they have to offer support that both the slack jawed yokel and the software engineer can understand, no where in their response is there even a shred of an answer to the question I posed.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;My follow-up request:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;    &lt;p&gt;I guess I should clarify. I'm NOT getting an error sending an email through your web client or anything like that. I am sending emails through my asp.net web site using the goaddy relay server as specified here; &lt;a href="http://help.godaddy.com/article/955"&gt;http://help.godaddy.com/article/955&lt;/a&gt;. Up until the past couple of days, this worked fine. I have made NO code changes and DO NOT require code help.. I am NOT getting any errors when I try to email through r&lt;a href="http://elay-hosting.secureserver.net"&gt;elay-hosting.secureserver.net&lt;/a&gt; but it is not working. Can someone please check this out?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Their response (again paraphrased):&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We need to know how to reproduce this.&#160; Please give us more information.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While I was pretty sure I had specified EXACTLY how I was using their mail relay to send email through my asp.net web site, I'll give them a bone and try to be helpful.&#160; My next (we're on number 3 here) email explained how to get to my contact page and exactly what happened (again that it sent email through their relay server) when they used the form.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Their (3rd) response (paraphrased):&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What address are you expecting to receive this email on.&#160; We aren't showing any issues with our relay servers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It was at this point that I thought that maybe the emails were making it through and going to the spam folder.&#160; Sure enough, there they were.&#160; Every one had not passed the gmail or the Google Apps spam mail filter.&#160; With this in mind, I sent my 4th support request:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;    &lt;p&gt;After looking into this more on my side, I think that Google is blacklisting emails from &lt;a href="http://relay-hosting.secureserver.net"&gt;relay-hosting.secureserver.net&lt;/a&gt; If I send an email from any of my domains through &lt;a href="http://secureserver.net"&gt;secureserver.net&lt;/a&gt;'s relay, they are ending up in spam folders for gmail and google app accounts. I'm very certain it has to do with secureserver relaying the emails as when I send the emails through gmail or google apps (or any other relay I've tried using) they get to their destinations just fine. Just to stress this, the emails ONLY end up in the spam folders when sent through the secure server's relay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The important things here are that I'm stating that the emails going through their relay server are being marked as spam.&#160; However, if email is sent through the gmail (or google apps mail) interface, none of them are marked as spam.&#160; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;GoDaddy's 4th response:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;    &lt;p&gt;In case you are using a &quot;from&quot; address in your code with referring to our shared hosting email relay server, please confirm that you are not referring to a major free email provider such as Gmail as the &quot;from&quot; address, as this will most likely result in the emails being blocked.&#160;&#160; For testing / set-up purposes, we would recommend not referring t any free Web-based email service to confirm that you are referring to our email relay servers correctly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A fair point.&#160; The emails should show up as coming from my domain.&#160; Oh wait, they are.&#160; The emails were coming from either an address at this domain or an address at a different domain.&#160; Both hosted at GoDaddy, both sending emails through their relay.&#160; The important thing to remember here is that it wasn't just one domain I was having issues with.&#160; It was two separate domains.&#160; In my 5th response, I stated these things.&#160; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Their 5th response:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately we cannot control how emails are filtered by the recipient. Please note that our server admins work to keep our email servers off of block-lists. Since you do receive the messages it seems that we are not on their block-list. If you are receiving the messages in a spam, or bulk folder you will need to specify that the message is not spam to prevent this from happening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;First, I never asked them to do anything such as control how Google filter's their mail.&#160; Second, I never claimed the email servers were on a "block-list".&#160; For those of you not in the know, email providers, such as Google, use many different criteria when determining if an incoming email is spam.&#160; One of those ways is based off the "reputation" of the mail server it comes from.&#160; The idea being that as emails come through, if people say "this email is spam", that mail server's reputation goes down.&#160; Eventually it get's to a point where all emails coming from it are marked as spam by that email provider.&#160; If the mail server continues to offend, it's put on a "block-list" and emails just aren't let through at all.&#160; So while I never said the mail server was on a "block-list", I certainly wouldn't be insane thinking that maybe their mail server had been &lt;strong&gt;blacklisted&lt;/strong&gt; and the emails marked as spam.&#160; At this point, I was really just looking for them to at least own up to the possibility that their mail server's reputation was so bad, emails were getting sent directly to spam folders.&#160; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;My 6th, and final support communication:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Perhaps I am missing something that you can explain. Two separate domains that I have hosted through GoDaddy are both using GoDaddy's mail relay server. Suddenly, mail from both of these domains start failing Google's spam filter. However, when emails are sent via these email accounts (not using the relay server) they do not fail the spam filter. I think my assumption that there is an issue with the relay servers' email being marked as spam is solid. As it stands, I am unable to use a secure external relay due to port 587 being blocked. In addition, you seem unwilling or incapable of offering any real assistance. Can my ticket be escalated please?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So here, I'm laying my case out completely.&#160; Two different domains, both using the GoDaddy mail relay, have both started being sent directly to the spam folders of google mail accounts.&#160; Emails sent through these accounts NOT using the relay server (either through the mail interface or their smtp / imap clients) are not marked as spam.&#160; Furthermore, I can't switch to using gmail's SMTP mail relay to send my emails from my web site.&#160; Due to ports being blocked, GoDaddy's mail relay is my only option.&#160; At this point, I'm tired of dealing with people that can't answer any of my questions to any degree of satisfaction.&#160; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Their 6th response:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;    &lt;p&gt;As stated in our previous response, we cannot control how Google filters their mail.

I actually had a conversation with a friend that works for GD and he said that &quot;spammers had sent emails as though they were coming from my domain&quot; which is what was causing my emails to get blacklisted and that it wasn't GD's mail relays causing issues.    I'm pretty sure that's both not likely and not possible.  If it wasn't the mail relays, my emails should have been treated like spam whether sent through the mail relay or through Google Apps interface and they weren't.  Furthermore, I would assume I'd have gotten some sort of email from someone saying that there was spam coming from my domain.    Sadly as long as the complainers are in the minority, they don't have any real motivation to change.</wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment></item>

If you were paying attention, you know that part 6 in our &lt;a title="Veritas Blog Engine" href="http://chrisrisner.com/Veritas--Creating-a-Blog-Engine-with-MVC-2-and--Net-4-0-%E2%80%93-Part-1"&gt;Veritas Blog Engine series&lt;/a&gt; was supposed to be about Error Logging.&#160; Well, we're going to go a bit out of order and do Data Access first.&#160; The reason for this is that we're going to use a lot of our data access methods in the sections I originally thought we'd write first.&#160; I ran into quite a bit of &lt;a title="Entity Framework 3.5" href="http://chrisrisner.com/MVC2-%E2%80%93-Adding-Data-Annotation-Validation-for-Entity-Framework-Entities"&gt;trouble the last time I played with Entity Framework&lt;/a&gt; when it was 3.5.&#160; Thankfully, they made quite a few improvements with 4.0 so we're going to give it another try.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a onclick="return hs.expand(this)" class="highslide" href="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/VeritasEDMX.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="border-right-width: 0px; margin: 0px 10px 0px 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="Veritas EDMX" border="0" alt="Veritas EDMX" align="left" src="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/VeritasEDMX.jpg" width="239" height="244" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; First things first, if you haven't already done so, add a Models folder to your DataLayer project.&#160; All of our database objects and any extensions will sit in this folder and namespace.&#160; After that, we'll add a "ADO .Net Entity Data Model" which is the Entity Framework file that we generate all of our database classes and connections in.&#160; Like every past version of Microsoft's "This is the way to do database access", we get to generate the majority of our code straight from the database.&#160; Included in this is the same functionality we had with the Linq2Sql generator for pluralizing / singularizing object names (though now it's optional) as well as including foreign key columns in the models (which will hopefully fix the FK problems that plagued 3.5 (seriously it was like they designed it to be hard to have foreign key constraints).&#160; Once we've selected all of our tables and tell it to generate we're given an EDMX file and presented with a fantastic database diagram view.&#160; Now, technically, we've generated our database access.&#160; We could call it a day.&#160; However, since we're using the &lt;a title="repository" href="http://chrisrisner.com/Veritas-%E2%80%93-Base-Objects-%E2%80%93-Part-5"&gt;repository pattern&lt;/a&gt; and we want all of our data access methods to be in one place, we'll go ahead and create all of those methods in the repository class we made in the last entry.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Before we can add any data access methods we need to add a instance of our Entities object (EDMX) to our repository like so:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class="csharpcode"&gt;   &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; VeritasBlogDBV3Entities db = &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; VeritasBlogDBV3Entities();&lt;/pre&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;style type="text/css"&gt;      .csharpcode, .csharpcode pre  {   font-size: small;   color: black;   font-family: consolas, "Courier New", courier, monospace;   background-color: #ffffff;   /*white-space: pre;*/  }  .csharpcode pre { margin: 0em; }  .csharpcode .rem { color: #008000; }  .csharpcode .kwrd { color: #0000ff; }  .csharpcode .str { color: #006080; }  .csharpcode .op { color: #0000c0; }  .csharpcode .preproc { color: #cc6633; }  .csharpcode .asp { background-color: #ffff00; }  .csharpcode .html { color: #800000; }  .csharpcode .attr { color: #ff0000; }  .csharpcode .alt   {   background-color: #f4f4f4;   width: 100%;   margin: 0em;  }  .csharpcode .lnum { color: #606060; }&lt;/style&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;So inside of our repository class we'll use db. to do all our database interaction.&#160; The first method we'll create is our Save method.&#160; This method handles saving any inserts, updates, and deletes after they're done:&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;div class="csharpcode"&gt;    &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   1:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="rem"&gt;/// &lt;summary&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   2:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="rem"&gt;/// Saves all DB changes and then accepts the changes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   3:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="rem"&gt;/// &lt;/summary&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   4:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; Save()&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   5:  &lt;/span&gt;{&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   6:  &lt;/span&gt;    db.SaveChanges(System.Data.Objects.SaveOptions.AcceptAllChangesAfterSave);&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   7:  &lt;/span&gt;}&lt;/pre&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;style type="text/css"&gt;      .csharpcode, .csharpcode pre  {   font-size: small;   color: black;   font-family: consolas, "Courier New", courier, monospace;   background-color: #ffffff;   /*white-space: pre;*/  }  .csharpcode pre { margin: 0em; }  .csharpcode .rem { color: #008000; }  .csharpcode .kwrd { color: #0000ff; }  .csharpcode .str { color: #006080; }  .csharpcode .op { color: #0000c0; }  .csharpcode .preproc { color: #cc6633; }  .csharpcode .asp { background-color: #ffff00; }  .csharpcode .html { color: #800000; }  .csharpcode .attr { color: #ff0000; }  .csharpcode .alt   {   background-color: #f4f4f4;   width: 100%;   margin: 0em;  }  .csharpcode .lnum { color: #606060; }&lt;/style&gt;    &lt;p&gt;We'll call this method after doing any DB changes (or after any group of DB changes if we're not doing them individually).&#160; After this, we'll add entries (separated out into regions) for each of our objects for adding and deleting.&#160; So for example, here are the methods for the BlogConfig object:&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;div class="csharpcode"&gt;    &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   1:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="preproc"&gt;#region&lt;/span&gt; BlogConfig&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   2:  &lt;/span&gt;&#160;&lt;/pre&gt;

 &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;style type="text/css"&gt;      .csharpcode, .csharpcode pre  {   font-size: small;   color: black;   font-family: consolas, "Courier New", courier, monospace;   background-color: #ffffff;

  width: 100%;   margin: 0em;  }  .csharpcode .lnum { color: #606060; }&lt;/style&gt;    &lt;p&gt;These are pretty simple methods and just handle telling our entity object that we want to insert or delete something.&#160; The Save method still has to be called after each of these.&#160; A quick note on the delete methods:&#160; we may or may not end up ever using them.&#160; Typically I don't like deleting data as much as "marking it inactive" for historical purposes.&#160; We're going to write some unit tests in a second so we're going to write a method to pull all our BlogConfigs from the DB.&#160; We won't end up using this anywhere but in our unit test.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;div class="csharpcode"&gt;    &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   1:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; IEnumerable&lt;BlogConfig&gt; GetAllBlogConfigs()&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   2:  &lt;/span&gt;{&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   3:  &lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; db.BlogConfigs;&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   4:  &lt;/span&gt;}&lt;/pre&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;style type="text/css"&gt;      .csharpcode, .csharpcode pre  {   font-size: small;   color: black;   font-family: consolas, "Courier New", courier, monospace;   background-color: #ffffff;   /*white-space: pre;*/  }  .csharpcode pre { margin: 0em; }  .csharpcode .rem { color: #008000; }  .csharpcode .kwrd { color: #0000ff; }  .csharpcode .str { color: #006080;

}  .csharpcode .alt   {   background-color: #f4f4f4;   width: 100%;   margin: 0em;  }  .csharpcode .lnum { color: #606060; }&lt;/style&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Now, before we can actually write some unit tests, we need to implement the StartTransaction and RollbackTransaction methods we made in the last entry.&#160; These methods will be called before and after any unit tests so we're not actually putting anything in the database.&#160; &lt;/p&gt;    &lt;div class="csharpcode"&gt;    &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   1:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; DbTransaction Transaction { get; set; }&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   2:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="rem"&gt;/// &lt;summary&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   3:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="rem"&gt;/// Will create a new transation.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;

  9:  &lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;.Transaction = trans;&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  10:  &lt;/span&gt;}&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;

     &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  15:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; RollbackTransaction()&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;

   &lt;div class="csharpcode"&gt;    &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   1:  &lt;/span&gt;[TestClass()]&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   2:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt;

 &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;style type="text/css"&gt;      .csharpcode, .csharpcode pre  {   font-size: small;   color: black;   font-family: consolas, "Courier New", courier, monospace;   background-color: #ffffff;

When the test is done, it will call the RollbackTransaction method on the repo.&#160; If everything goes well, it will create a new config object, insert it into the database, save that change, pull it back, and make sure it comes back from the DB.&#160; Since most of our tests (such as our DeleteConfig test) will rely on having a BlogConfig and a BlogUser (if not many more things) to already be in the DB, we'll eventually insert all of these in the test initialize but for now, we can add all of our Add / Delete methods and create tests for them.&#160; Since we need to be able to pull records back from the database to make sure our tests are working, we'll need to add more methods like the GetAllBlogConfigs seen above.&#160; There are a lot of methods that we'll in our repository that we're not going to list here so if you want to see them all, download the files and check out the repo.&#160; As of now, we've got what should be all the data access methods we'll need as well as the unit tests for all of them.&#160; As always, you can &lt;a title="Veritas Part 6" href="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/Veritas Part 6.zip"&gt;download the latest here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><dsq:thread_identifier>Veritas---Data-Access-with-Entity-Framework-4-0---Part-6</dsq:thread_identifier><wp:post_date_gmt>2010-07-12 22:51:00.000</wp:post_date_gmt><wp:comment_status>open</wp:comment_status><wp:comment><dsq:remote><dsq:id>4</dsq:id><dsq:avatar/></dsq:remote><wp:comment_id>159</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Chris</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>chris@chrisrisner.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://chrisrisner.com</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>71.65.4.130</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2010-07-22 21:04:50.457</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content>Ok Steve, next post will be something ridiculous that has nothing to do with programming (hopefully).</wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment></item>

To continue with the scheme of the &lt;a title="Last Veritas Entry" href="http://chrisrisner.com/Veritas-%E2%80%93-Data-Access-with-Entity-Framework-4-0-%E2%80%93-Part-6"&gt;last entry&lt;/a&gt;, we're going to again depart from our &lt;a title="Veritas Series" href="http://chrisrisner.com/Veritas--Creating-a-Blog-Engine-with-MVC-2-and--Net-4-0-%E2%80%93-Part-1"&gt;originally planned series&lt;/a&gt;.&nbsp; Today we're going to talk about our Blog Configuration.&nbsp; As we discussed in the &lt;a title="Initial Database Design" href="http://chrisrisner.com/Veritas--Database-Design-%E2%80%93-Part-2"&gt;initial database design entry&lt;/a&gt;, our blog config database table primarily consists of an XML column.&nbsp; Instead of creating a column for each setting we might want, we'll store it all dynamically as XML.&nbsp; Furthermore, there is no way I'm going to think of all the config settings we'll want while I'm writing this.&nbsp; Rather then trying to update this entry every time I think of something new, we'll just outline what we're going to do in our BlogConfig object so when we decide to add something else down the road, you'll understand.&nbsp; First we'll add a BlogConfig class to the Models folder in our DataLayer.&nbsp; This will be a partial class and will expand on our already created BlogConfig object (it was created as part of our Entity Framework EDMX):&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="csharpcode"&gt;&lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   1:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;namespace&lt;/span&gt; Veritas.DataLayer.Models&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;

 &lt;div class="csharpcode"&gt;&lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   1:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;namespace&lt;/span&gt; Veritas.DataLayer.Models&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;

Lastly we'll add methods to load our xml from the properties and to load the properties from the xml:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class="csharpcode"&gt;&lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   1:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt;

To continue with the scheme of the &lt;a title="Last Veritas Entry" href="http://chrisrisner.com/Veritas-%E2%80%93-Data-Access-with-Entity-Framework-4-0-%E2%80%93-Part-6"&gt;last entry&lt;/a&gt;, we're going to again depart from our &lt;a title="Veritas Series" href="http://chrisrisner.com/Veritas--Creating-a-Blog-Engine-with-MVC-2-and--Net-4-0-%E2%80%93-Part-1"&gt;originally planned series&lt;/a&gt;.&nbsp; Today we're going to talk about our Blog Configuration.&nbsp; As we discussed in the &lt;a title="Initial Database Design" href="http://chrisrisner.com/Veritas--Database-Design-%E2%80%93-Part-2"&gt;initial database design entry&lt;/a&gt;, our blog config database table primarily consists of an XML column.&nbsp; Instead of creating a column for each setting we might want, we'll store it all dynamically as XML.&nbsp; Furthermore, there is no way I'm going to think of all the config settings we'll want while I'm writing this.&nbsp; Rather then trying to update this entry every time I think of something new, we'll just outline what we're going to do in our BlogConfig object so when we decide to add something else down the road, you'll understand.&nbsp; First we'll add a BlogConfig class to the Models folder in our DataLayer.&nbsp; This will be a partial class and will expand on our already created BlogConfig object (it was created as part of our Entity Framework EDMX):&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="csharpcode"&gt;&lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   1:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;namespace&lt;/span&gt; Veritas.DataLayer.Models&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   2:  &lt;/span&gt;{&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   3:  &lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;partial&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; BlogConfig&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   4:  &lt;/span&gt;    {&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   5:  &lt;/span&gt;        &lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   6:  &lt;/span&gt;    }&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   7:  &lt;/span&gt;}&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;p&gt;  &lt;style type="text/css"&gt;.csharpcode, .csharpcode pre  {   font-size: small;

To continue with the scheme of the &lt;a title="Last Veritas Entry" href="http://chrisrisner.com/Veritas-%E2%80%93-Data-Access-with-Entity-Framework-4-0-%E2%80%93-Part-6"&gt;last entry&lt;/a&gt;, we're going to again depart from our &lt;a title="Veritas Series" href="http://chrisrisner.com/Veritas--Creating-a-Blog-Engine-with-MVC-2-and--Net-4-0-%E2%80%93-Part-1"&gt;originally planned series&lt;/a&gt;.&nbsp; Today we're going to talk about our Blog Configuration.&nbsp; As we discussed in the &lt;a title="Initial Database Design" href="http://chrisrisner.com/Veritas--Database-Design-%E2%80%93-Part-2"&gt;initial database design entry&lt;/a&gt;, our blog config database table primarily consists of an XML column.&nbsp; Instead of creating a column for each setting we might want, we'll store it all dynamically as XML.&nbsp; Furthermore, there is no way I'm going to think of all the config settings we'll want while I'm writing this.&nbsp; Rather then trying to update this entry every time I think of something new, we'll just outline what we're going to do in our BlogConfig object so when we decide to add something else down the road, you'll understand.&nbsp; First we'll add a BlogConfig class to the Models folder in our DataLayer.&nbsp; This will be a partial class and will expand on our already created BlogConfig object (it was created as part of our Entity Framework EDMX):&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="csharpcode"&gt;&lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   1:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;namespace&lt;/span&gt; Veritas.DataLayer.Models&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   2:  &lt;/span&gt;{&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   3:  &lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;partial&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; BlogConfig&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   4:  &lt;/span&gt;    {&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   5:  &lt;/span&gt;        &lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   6:  &lt;/span&gt;    }&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   7:  &lt;/span&gt;}&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;p&gt;  &lt;style type="text/css"&gt;.csharpcode, .csharpcode pre  {   font-size: small;   color: black;   font-family: consolas, "Courier New", courier, monospace;   background-color: #ffffff;   /*white-space: pre;*/  }  .csharpcode pre { margin: 0em; }  .csharpcode .rem { color: #008000; }  .csharpcode .kwrd { color: #0000ff; }  .csharpcode .str { color: #006080; }  .csharpcode .op { color: #0000c0; }  .csharpcode .preproc { color: #cc6633; }  .csharpcode .asp { background-color: #ffff00; }  .csharpcode .html { color: #800000; }  .csharpcode .attr { color: #ff0000; }  .csharpcode .alt   {   background-color: #f4f4f4;   width: 100%;   margin: 0em;  }  .csharpcode .lnum { color: #606060; }  &lt;/style&gt;  We're probably going to end up with dozens of settings (at least) but we're only going to handle three of them for now.&nbsp; We'll add a boolean that will control if comments are allowed on the site, a string to contain the "about" information of the blog, and an int to store the number of posts:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class="csharpcode"&gt;&lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   1:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;namespace&lt;/span&gt; Veritas.DataLayer.Models&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   2:  &lt;/span&gt;{&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   3:  &lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;partial&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; BlogConfig&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   4:  &lt;/span&gt;    {&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   5:  &lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt; AllowComments { get; set; }&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   6:  &lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; BlogAbout { get; set; }        &lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   7:  &lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; PostCount { get; set; }&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   8:  &lt;/span&gt;    }&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   9:  &lt;/span&gt;}&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;style type="text/css"&gt;.csharpcode, .csharpcode pre  {   font-size: small;   color: black;   font-family: consolas, "Courier New", courier, monospace;   background-color: #ffffff;   /*white-space: pre;*/  }  .csharpcode pre { margin: 0em; }  .csharpcode .rem { color: #008000; }  .csharpcode .kwrd { color: #0000ff; }  .csharpcode .str { color: #006080; }  .csharpcode .op { color: #0000c0; }  .csharpcode .preproc { color: #cc6633; }  .csharpcode .asp { background-color: #ffff00; }  .csharpcode .html { color: #800000; }  .csharpcode .attr { color: #ff0000; }  .csharpcode .alt   {   background-color: #f4f4f4;   width: 100%;   margin: 0em;  }  .csharpcode .lnum { color: #606060; }  &lt;/style&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now, since we're not making columns for any of these, we're going to need to load them from the xml column whenever we load our BlogConfig object and pull them into the xml when we save it.&nbsp; Lastly we'll add methods to load our xml from the properties and to load the properties from the xml:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class="csharpcode"&gt;&lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   1:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; LoadConfigFromXml()&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   2:  &lt;/span&gt;{&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   3:  &lt;/span&gt;    XmlDocument doc = &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; XmlDocument();&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   4:  &lt;/span&gt;    doc.LoadXml(&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;.ConfigXml);            &lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   5:  &lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (doc.DocumentElement[&lt;span class="str"&gt;"AllowComments"&lt;/span&gt;] != &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   6:  &lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;.AllowComments = Convert.ToBoolean(doc.DocumentElement[&lt;span class="str"&gt;"AllowComments"&lt;/span&gt;].InnerText);&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   7:  &lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (doc.DocumentElement[&lt;span class="str"&gt;"BlogAbout"&lt;/span&gt;] != &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   8:  &lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;.BlogAbout = doc.DocumentElement[&lt;span class="str"&gt;"BlogAbout"&lt;/span&gt;].InnerText;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;

 10:  &lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;.PostCount = Convert.ToInt32(doc.DocumentElement[&lt;span class="str"&gt;"PostCount"&lt;/span&gt;].InnerText);&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  11:  &lt;/span&gt;}&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  12:  &lt;/span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  13:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt;

Is there an issue with the mail server?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Their response was (paraphrased):&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you continue to experience a problem, please let us know the url of the page as well as the steps we can take to duplicate the issue.&#160; Also, here's how to take a screenshot.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While I understand that they have to offer support that both the slack jawed yokel and the software engineer can understand, no where in their response is there even a shred of an answer to the question I posed.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;My follow-up request:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;    &lt;p&gt;I guess I should clarify. I'm NOT getting an error sending an email through your web client or anything like that. I am sending emails through my asp.net web site using the goaddy relay server as specified here; &lt;a href="http://help.godaddy.com/article/955"&gt;http://help.godaddy.com/article/955&lt;/a&gt;. Up until the past couple of days, this worked fine. I have made NO code changes and DO NOT require code help.. I am NOT getting any errors when I try to email through r&lt;a href="http://elay-hosting.secureserver.net"&gt;elay-hosting.secureserver.net&lt;/a&gt; but it is not working. Can someone please check this out?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Their response (again paraphrased):&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We need to know how to reproduce this.&#160; Please give us more information.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While I was pretty sure I had specified EXACTLY how I was using their mail relay to send email through my asp.net web site, I'll give them a bone and try to be helpful.&#160; My next (we're on number 3 here) email explained how to get to my contact page and exactly what happened (again that it sent email through their relay server) when they used the form.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Their (3rd) response (paraphrased):&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What address are you expecting to receive this email on.&#160; We aren't showing any issues with our relay servers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It was at this point that I thought that maybe the emails were making it through and going to the spam folder.&#160; Sure enough, there they were.&#160; Every one had not passed the gmail or the Google Apps spam mail filter.&#160; With this in mind, I sent my 4th support request:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;    &lt;p&gt;After looking into this more on my side, I think that Google is blacklisting emails from &lt;a href="http://relay-hosting.secureserver.net"&gt;relay-hosting.secureserver.net&lt;/a&gt; If I send an email from any of my domains through &lt;a href="http://secureserver.net"&gt;secureserver.net&lt;/a&gt;'s relay, they are ending up in spam folders for gmail and google app accounts. I'm very certain it has to do with secureserver relaying the emails as when I send the emails through gmail or google apps (or any other relay I've tried using) they get to their destinations just fine. Just to stress this, the emails ONLY end up in the spam folders when sent through the secure server's relay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The important things here are that I'm stating that the emails going through their relay server are being marked as spam.&#160; However, if email is sent through the gmail (or google apps mail) interface, none of them are marked as spam.&#160; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;GoDaddy's 4th response:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;    &lt;p&gt;In case you are using a &quot;from&quot; address in your code with referring to our shared hosting email relay server, please confirm that you are not referring to a major free email provider such as Gmail as the &quot;from&quot; address, as this will most likely result in the emails being blocked.&#160;&#160; For testing / set-up purposes, we would recommend not referring t any free Web-based email service to confirm that you are referring to our email relay servers correctly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A fair point.&#160; The emails should show up as coming from my domain.&#160; Oh wait, they are.&#160; The emails were coming from either an address at this domain or an address at a different domain.&#160; Both hosted at GoDaddy, both sending emails through their relay.&#160; The important thing to remember here is that it wasn't just one domain I was having issues with.&#160; It was two separate domains.&#160; In my 5th response, I stated these things.&#160; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Their 5th response:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately we cannot control how emails are filtered by the recipient. Please note that our server admins work to keep our email servers off of block-lists. Since you do receive the messages it seems that we are not on their block-list. If you are receiving the messages in a spam, or bulk folder you will need to specify that the message is not spam to prevent this from happening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;First, I never asked them to do anything such as control how Google filter's their mail.&#160; Second, I never claimed the email servers were on a "block-list".&#160; For those of you not in the know, email providers, such as Google, use many different criteria when determining if an incoming email is spam.&#160; One of those ways is based off the "reputation" of the mail server it comes from.&#160; The idea being that as emails come through, if people say "this email is spam", that mail server's reputation goes down.&#160; Eventually it get's to a point where all emails coming from it are marked as spam by that email provider.&#160; If the mail server continues to offend, it's put on a "block-list" and emails just aren't let through at all.&#160; So while I never said the mail server was on a "block-list", I certainly wouldn't be insane thinking that maybe their mail server had been &lt;strong&gt;blacklisted&lt;/strong&gt; and the emails marked as spam.&#160; At this point, I was really just looking for them to at least own up to the possibility that their mail server's reputation was so bad, emails were getting sent directly to spam folders.&#160; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;My 6th, and final support communication:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Perhaps I am missing something that you can explain. Two separate domains that I have hosted through GoDaddy are both using GoDaddy's mail relay server. Suddenly, mail from both of these domains start failing Google's spam filter. However, when emails are sent via these email accounts (not using the relay server) they do not fail the spam filter. I think my assumption that there is an issue with the relay servers' email being marked as spam is solid. As it stands, I am unable to use a secure external relay due to port 587 being blocked. In addition, you seem unwilling or incapable of offering any real assistance. Can my ticket be escalated please?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So here, I'm laying my case out completely.&#160; Two different domains, both using the GoDaddy mail relay, have both started being sent directly to the spam folders of google mail accounts.&#160; Emails sent through these accounts NOT using the relay server (either through the mail interface or their smtp / imap clients) are not marked as spam.&#160; Furthermore, I can't switch to using gmail's SMTP mail relay to send my emails from my web site.&#160; Due to ports being blocked, GoDaddy's mail relay is my only option.&#160; At this point, I'm tired of dealing with people that can't answer any of my questions to any degree of satisfaction.&#160; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Their 6th response:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;    &lt;p&gt;As stated in our previous response, we cannot control how Google filters their mail. You will need to contact Google, or whitelist the emails to prevent them from being filtered as spam. We thank you for your understanding in this matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A complete failure to provide any assistance whatsoever.&#160; I did like that they said I could "whitelist" the emails despite a complete lack of explanation on why they might be "blackelisted" in the first place.&#160; As I can't switch to a different mail relay, as explained above, I don't really have any other options.&#160; I am currently in the process of examining alternative hosting solutions and have started recommending friends away from GoDaddy (two have already asked me questions leading to suggestions for alternate registrars and hosting solutions).&#160; I would rather start paying more for better service and actual options than continue with GoDaddy.&#160; (On a side note, GoDaddy might have 24 hour support, but when you state that there is a 2 hour wait for responses to email support questions and then take 4.5 hours to respond, your 24 hour support really doesn't mean shit).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;strong&gt;Update: 6/24/2010&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I've since moved all of my hosting off GoDaddy.

You can change the from address to something not hosted by Google or set your whitelist to allow the email. </wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment></item>
<item><title>re: MVC2 - Adding Data Annotation Validation for Entity Framework Entities</title><link>http://chrisrisner.com/MVC2-%E2%80%93-Adding-Data-Annotation-Validation-for-Entity-Framework-Entities</link><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 10px; display: inline" align="right" src="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/634062222138168483.jpg" /&gt; I was hoping to wait for .Net 4.0 to drop before I started making a real MVC2 work application but just got the opportunity to rewrite a smaller existing web project.&#160; MVC2 for .Net 3.5 seemed a logical choice.&#160; In addition to finally getting MVC2 into a project, I wanted to try messing around with Entity Framework.&#160; Being decently skilled with LINQ-to-SQL, getting some experience with it's successor, Entity Framework, seemed like a wise idea.&#160; After creating my models and adding some controllers and views.&#160; It was time to start testing out the new DataAnnotation validation.&#160; DataAnnotations allow you to place attributes on your entities' properties which handle making sure they are valid.&#160; So for example, if I had an ApplicationName property that I wanted to both require, and mandate that it was no longer than 50 characters, I could do the following:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div id="codeSnippetWrapper"&gt;   &lt;div style="border-bottom-style: none; text-align: left; padding-bottom: 0px; line-height: 12pt; border-right-style: none; background-color: #f4f4f4; padding-left: 0px; width: 100%; padding-right: 0px; font-family: &#39;Courier New&#39;, courier, monospace; direction: ltr; border-top-style: none; color: black; font-size: 8pt; border-left-style: none; overflow: visible; padding-top: 0px" id="codeSnippet"&gt;     &lt;pre style="border-bottom-style: none; text-align: left; padding-bottom: 0px; line-height: 12pt; border-right-style: none; background-color: white; margin: 0em; padding-left: 0px; width: 100%; padding-right: 0px; font-family: &#39;Courier New&#39;, courier, monospace; direction: ltr; border-top-style: none; color: black; font-size: 8pt; border-left-style: none; overflow: visible; padding-top: 0px"&gt;&lt;span style="color: #606060" id="lnum1"&gt;   1:&lt;/span&gt; [Required(ErrorMessage = &lt;span style="color: #006080"&gt;&quot;Application Name Required&quot;&lt;/span&gt;)]&lt;/pre&gt;  &lt;!--CRLF--&gt;        &lt;pre style="border-bottom-style: none; text-align: left; padding-bottom: 0px; line-height: 12pt; border-right-style: none; background-color: #f4f4f4; margin: 0em; padding-left: 0px; width: 100%; padding-right: 0px; font-family: &#39;Courier New&#39;, courier, monospace;

[StringLength(50, ErrorMessage = &lt;span style="color: #006080"&gt;&quot;Application name must be under 50 characters&quot;&lt;/span&gt;)]&lt;/pre&gt;  &lt;!--CRLF--&gt;        &lt;pre style="border-bottom-style: none;

&lt;span style="color: #0000ff"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #0000ff"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; ApplicationName { get; set; }&lt;/pre&gt;  &lt;!--CRLF--&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The first issue I came across had to do with Entity Framework.&#160; I can't add these annotations to the generated code from EF.&#160; The next time I edited my model, my annotations would be overwritten.&#160; So following &lt;a title="Scott Gu&#39;s Entity Framework Validation" href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2010/01/15/asp-net-mvc-2-model-validation.aspx"&gt;Scott Gu's example&lt;/a&gt;, I created a buddy class.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;div id="codeSnippetWrapper"&gt;    &lt;div style="border-bottom-style: none; text-align: left; padding-bottom: 0px; line-height: 12pt; border-right-style: none; background-color: #f4f4f4; padding-left: 0px;

  &lt;span style="color: #008000"&gt;//Properties with annotations as seen above&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;  &lt;!--CRLF--&gt;        &lt;pre style="border-bottom-style: none; text-align: left; padding-bottom: 0px; line-height: 12pt; border-right-style: none; background-color: #f4f4f4; margin: 0em; padding-left: 0px; width: 100%; padding-right: 0px; font-family: &#39;Courier New&#39;, courier, monospace; direction: ltr;

It didn't.&#160; For some reason, my validation was never being hit.&#160; I scoured the web.&#160; I ended up trying to add a ValidationAttribute and a DataAnnotationsModelValidator (as &lt;a title="Phil Haack and MVC2 Custom Validation" href="http://haacked.com/archive/2009/11/19/aspnetmvc2-custom-validation.aspx"&gt;described by Phil Haack here&lt;/a&gt;).&#160; It was referewhen adding these that I started getting a compilation error saying that my reference to System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations was not correct.&#160; I was referencing the 3.6.0.0 version when the attribute and model validator required 3.5.0.0.&#160; The data annotations and the buddy class set up did not care at all which version of the DLL was referenced, hence there was nothing to indicate this might be an issue.&#160; After switching the DLL and commenting out the ValidationAttribute and DataAnnotationsModelValidator, my validation continued to work fine.&#160; So, if you run afoul of any issues with your validation working, be sure to check your version of System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.      &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><dsq:thread_identifier>MVC2---Adding-Data-Annotation-Validation-for-Entity-Framework-Entities</dsq:thread_identifier><wp:post_date_gmt>2010-04-07 09:54:00.000</wp:post_date_gmt><wp:comment_status>open</wp:comment_status><wp:comment><dsq:remote><dsq:id>42</dsq:id><dsq:avatar/></dsq:remote><wp:comment_id>165</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Ed Burns</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>eburns@intermedia4web.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>72.189.237.132</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2010-08-13 19:35:17.153</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content>I'm having very similar problems getting the validation buddy class to process my form before it tries to updated the Entity Framework 4 model.

<item><title>re: MVC2 - Adding Data Annotation Validation for Entity Framework Entities</title><link>http://chrisrisner.com/MVC2-%E2%80%93-Adding-Data-Annotation-Validation-for-Entity-Framework-Entities</link><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 10px; display: inline" align="right" src="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/634062222138168483.jpg" /&gt; I was hoping to wait for .Net 4.0 to drop before I started making a real MVC2 work application but just got the opportunity to rewrite a smaller existing web project.&#160; MVC2 for .Net 3.5 seemed a logical choice.&#160; In addition to finally getting MVC2 into a project, I wanted to try messing around with Entity Framework.&#160; Being decently skilled with LINQ-to-SQL, getting some experience with it's successor, Entity Framework, seemed like a wise idea.&#160; After creating my models and adding some controllers and views.&#160; It was time to start testing out the new DataAnnotation validation.&#160; DataAnnotations allow you to place attributes on your entities' properties which handle making sure they are valid.&#160; So for example, if I had an ApplicationName property that I wanted to both require, and mandate that it was no longer than 50 characters, I could do the following:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div id="codeSnippetWrapper"&gt;   &lt;div style="border-bottom-style: none; text-align: left; padding-bottom: 0px; line-height: 12pt; border-right-style: none; background-color: #f4f4f4; padding-left: 0px; width: 100%; padding-right: 0px; font-family: &#39;Courier New&#39;, courier, monospace; direction: ltr; border-top-style: none; color: black; font-size: 8pt; border-left-style: none; overflow: visible; padding-top: 0px" id="codeSnippet"&gt;     &lt;pre style="border-bottom-style: none; text-align: left; padding-bottom: 0px; line-height: 12pt; border-right-style: none; background-color: white; margin: 0em; padding-left: 0px; width: 100%; padding-right: 0px; font-family: &#39;Courier New&#39;, courier, monospace; direction: ltr; border-top-style: none; color: black; font-size: 8pt; border-left-style: none; overflow: visible; padding-top: 0px"&gt;&lt;span style="color: #606060" id="lnum1"&gt;   1:&lt;/span&gt; [Required(ErrorMessage = &lt;span style="color: #006080"&gt;&quot;Application Name Required&quot;&lt;/span&gt;)]&lt;/pre&gt;  &lt;!--CRLF--&gt;        &lt;pre style="border-bottom-style: none; text-align: left; padding-bottom: 0px; line-height: 12pt; border-right-style: none; background-color: #f4f4f4; margin: 0em; padding-left: 0px; width: 100%; padding-right: 0px; font-family: &#39;Courier New&#39;, courier, monospace;

[StringLength(50, ErrorMessage = &lt;span style="color: #006080"&gt;&quot;Application name must be under 50 characters&quot;&lt;/span&gt;)]&lt;/pre&gt;  &lt;!--CRLF--&gt;        &lt;pre style="border-bottom-style: none;

&lt;span style="color: #0000ff"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #0000ff"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; ApplicationName { get; set; }&lt;/pre&gt;  &lt;!--CRLF--&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The first issue I came across had to do with Entity Framework.&#160; I can't add these annotations to the generated code from EF.&#160; The next time I edited my model, my annotations would be overwritten.&#160; So following &lt;a title="Scott Gu&#39;s Entity Framework Validation" href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2010/01/15/asp-net-mvc-2-model-validation.aspx"&gt;Scott Gu's example&lt;/a&gt;, I created a buddy class.&lt;/p&gt;

Today's short article is about error handling.&#160; In addition to recording errors to our BlogLog table which we &lt;a title="Veritas DB Design" href="http://chrisrisner.com/Veritas--Database-Design-%E2%80%93-Part-2"&gt;discussed previously&lt;/a&gt;, we'll also program in the capability to log to both email and a text file.&#160; If you controlled the server you were going to host on, you could look at other options (writing to the event log, logging through a MSMQ) but since we're writing this to work on a shared host, we'll only use the options that we know (should) work.&#160; To begin with we'll add some settings to the BlogConfig class to control whether or not we log to each source:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class="csharpcode"&gt;   &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   1:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; LogEmailAddress { get; set; }&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   2:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; LogFilePath { get; set; }&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   3:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt; LogToDb { get; set; }&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   4:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt; LogToEmail { get; set; }&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   5:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt; LogToFile { get; set; }&lt;/pre&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;style type="text/css"&gt;  .csharpcode, .csharpcode pre  {   font-size: small;   color: black;   font-family: consolas, "Courier New", courier, monospace;   background-color: #ffffff;   /*white-space: pre;*/  }  .csharpcode pre { margin: 0em; }  .csharpcode .rem { color: #008000; }  .csharpcode .kwrd { color: #0000ff; }  .csharpcode .str { color: #006080; }  .csharpcode .op { color: #0000c0; }  .csharpcode .preproc { color: #cc6633; }  .csharpcode .asp { background-color: #ffff00; }  .csharpcode .html { color: #800000; }  .csharpcode .attr { color: #ff0000; }  .csharpcode .alt   {   background-color: #f4f4f4;   width: 100%;   margin: 0em;  }  .csharpcode .lnum { color: #606060; }&lt;/style&gt;&lt;style type="text/css"&gt;  .csharpcode, .csharpcode pre  {   font-size: small;   color: black;   font-family: consolas, "Courier New", courier, monospace;   background-color: #ffffff;   /*white-space: pre;*/  }  .csharpcode pre { margin: 0em; }  .csharpcode .rem { color: #008000; }  .csharpcode .kwrd { color: #0000ff; }  .csharpcode .str { color: #006080;

We'll also add those fields into all of the load and build xml methods in our BlogConfig class.&#160; Once that's done, we'll add a new Logging Handler class into our Business Layer.&#160; The first thing we need is a property to check and see if each type of logging is enabled.&#160; These getters will just reach into our BlogConfig to see if the property above is set to true or false:&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;div class="csharpcode"&gt;    &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   1:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt; IsDbLoggingEnabled&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   2:  &lt;/span&gt;{&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   3:  &lt;/span&gt;     get&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   4:  &lt;/span&gt;     {&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   5:  &lt;/span&gt;          &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; CacheHandler.GetBlogConfig().LogToDb;&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   6:  &lt;/span&gt;     }&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   7:  &lt;/span&gt;}&lt;/pre&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;style type="text/css"&gt;  .csharpcode, .csharpcode pre  {   font-size: small;   color: black;   font-family: consolas, "Courier New", courier, monospace;   background-color: #ffffff;   /*white-space: pre;*/  }  .csharpcode pre { margin: 0em; }  .csharpcode .rem { color: #008000;

}&lt;/style&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;We're going to create two methods for each type of logging.&#160; One that takes in an exception and one that takes in individual details (in case we're not logging a specific exception).&#160; Both of these methods will also take in the "logging source" (the method or file calling the logging method).&#160; Before we create those, we'll create our helper methods to take in those details and create a BlogLog object:&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;div class="csharpcode"&gt;    &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   1:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; BlogLog GetBlogLog(&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; message, &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; details, &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; level, &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; logger)&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   2:  &lt;/span&gt;{&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   3:  &lt;/span&gt;    BlogLog log = &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; BlogLog()&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   4:  &lt;/span&gt;    {&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   5:  &lt;/span&gt;        BlogConfigId = CacheHandler.BlogConfigId,&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;

  8:  &lt;/span&gt;        Exception = details,&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   9:  &lt;/span&gt;        Message = message,&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;

 12:  &lt;/span&gt;    };&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  13:  &lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; log;&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  14:  &lt;/span&gt;}&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  15:  &lt;/span&gt;&#160;&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  16:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; BlogLog GetBlogLog(Exception ex, &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; logger)&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  17:  &lt;/span&gt;{&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  18:  &lt;/span&gt;    BlogLog log = &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; BlogLog()&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  19:  &lt;/span&gt;    {&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  20:  &lt;/span&gt;        BlogConfigId = CacheHandler.BlogConfigId,&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  21:  &lt;/span&gt;        CreateDate = DateTime.Now,&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  22:  &lt;/span&gt;        EventLevel = &lt;span class="str"&gt;&quot;Error&quot;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  23:  &lt;/span&gt;        Exception = GetInfoFromException(ex),&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  24:  &lt;/span&gt;        Message = ex.Message,&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;

 29:  &lt;/span&gt;}&lt;/pre&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;style type="text/css"&gt;  .csharpcode, .csharpcode pre  {   font-size: small;   color: black;   font-family: consolas, "Courier New", courier, monospace;

It will simply concatenate a few of the details of the exception:&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;div class="csharpcode"&gt;    &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   1:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; GetInfoFromException(Exception ex)&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   2:  &lt;/span&gt;{&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   3:  &lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; stackTrace = ex.StackTrace + &lt;span class="str"&gt;&quot;\n\n&quot;&lt;/span&gt;;&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   4:  &lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (ex.InnerException != &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   5:  &lt;/span&gt;        stackTrace += LoggingHandler.GetInfoFromException(ex.InnerException);&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   6:  &lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; stackTrace;&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   7:  &lt;/span&gt;}&lt;/pre&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;style type="text/css"&gt;  .csharpcode, .csharpcode pre  {   font-size: small;   color: black;   font-family: consolas, "Courier New", courier, monospace;   background-color: #ffffff;   /*white-space: pre;*/  }  .csharpcode pre { margin: 0em; }  .csharpcode .rem { color: #008000;

}&lt;/style&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Finally we'll create our two actual logging methods.&#160; As you'll see, these will both make use of our GetBlogLog methods above:&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;div class="csharpcode"&gt;    &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   1:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt;

logger)&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   2:  &lt;/span&gt;{&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   3:  &lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (LoggingHandler.IsDbLoggingEnabled)&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   4:  &lt;/span&gt;    {&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   5:  &lt;/span&gt;        BlogLog log = LoggingHandler.GetBlogLog(message, details, level, logger);&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   6:  &lt;/span&gt;&#160;&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   7:  &lt;/span&gt;        var repo = VeritasRepository.GetInstance();&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   8:  &lt;/span&gt;        repo.Add(log);&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   9:  &lt;/span&gt;        repo.Save();&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  10:  &lt;/span&gt;    }&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  11:  &lt;/span&gt;}&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  12:  &lt;/span&gt;&#160;&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  13:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; LogToDb(Exception ex, &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; logger)&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  14:  &lt;/span&gt;{&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  15:  &lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (LoggingHandler.IsDbLoggingEnabled)&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  16:  &lt;/span&gt;    {&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  17:  &lt;/span&gt;        BlogLog log = LoggingHandler.GetBlogLog(ex, logger);&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  18:  &lt;/span&gt;&#160;&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  19:  &lt;/span&gt;        var repo = VeritasRepository.GetInstance();&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  20:  &lt;/span&gt;        repo.Add(log);&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  21:  &lt;/span&gt;        repo.Save();&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  22:  &lt;/span&gt;    }&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  23:  &lt;/span&gt;}&lt;/pre&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;style type="text/css"&gt;  .csharpcode, .csharpcode pre  {   font-size: small;

}&lt;/style&gt;    &lt;p&gt;That's it for logging to the database.&#160; We've got two additional methods that will log to email and log to a file but we won't show those for brevity's sake.&#160; If you want, you can check out the code attached to see what those look like.&#160; We're now able to log any errors or information we might want to from anywhere else in the code and we can do it in several different ways.&#160; However, we need a method that will handle figuring out where and what to log to so we don't have to pick and choose in other locations:&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;div class="csharpcode"&gt;    &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   1:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; Log(&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; message, &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; details, &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; level, &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; logger)&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   2:  &lt;/span&gt;{&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   3:  &lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (LoggingHandler.IsDbLoggingEnabled)&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   4:  &lt;/span&gt;        LogToDb(message, details, level, logger);&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   5:  &lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (LoggingHandler.IsEmailLoggingEnabled)&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   6:  &lt;/span&gt;        LogToEmail(message, details, level, logger);&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   7:  &lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (LoggingHandler.IsFileLoggingEnabled)&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   8:  &lt;/span&gt;        LogToFile(message, details, level, logger);&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   9:  &lt;/span&gt;}&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;

&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; Log(Exception ex, &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; logger)&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  12:  &lt;/span&gt;{&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  13:  &lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (LoggingHandler.IsDbLoggingEnabled)&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;

Today's short article is about error handling.&#160; In addition to recording errors to our BlogLog table which we &lt;a title="Veritas DB Design" href="http://chrisrisner.com/Veritas--Database-Design-%E2%80%93-Part-2"&gt;discussed previously&lt;/a&gt;, we'll also program in the capability to log to both email and a text file.&#160; If you controlled the server you were going to host on, you could look at other options (writing to the event log, logging through a MSMQ) but since we're writing this to work on a shared host, we'll only use the options that we know (should) work.&#160; To begin with we'll add some settings to the BlogConfig class to control whether or not we log to each source:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class="csharpcode"&gt;   &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   1:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; LogEmailAddress { get; set; }&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   2:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; LogFilePath { get; set; }&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   3:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt; LogToDb { get; set; }&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   4:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt; LogToEmail { get; set; }&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   5:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt; LogToFile { get; set; }&lt;/pre&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;style type="text/css"&gt;  .csharpcode, .csharpcode pre  {   font-size: small;   color: black;   font-family: consolas, "Courier New", courier, monospace;   background-color: #ffffff;   /*white-space: pre;*/  }  .csharpcode pre { margin: 0em; }  .csharpcode .rem { color: #008000; }  .csharpcode .kwrd { color: #0000ff; }  .csharpcode .str { color: #006080; }  .csharpcode .op { color: #0000c0;

  background-color: #ffffff;   /*white-space: pre;*/  }  .csharpcode pre { margin: 0em; }  .csharpcode .rem { color: #008000; }  .csharpcode .kwrd { color: #0000ff; }  .csharpcode .str { color: #006080;

We'll also add those fields into all of the load and build xml methods in our BlogConfig class.&#160; Once that's done, we'll add a new Logging Handler class into our Business Layer.&#160; The first thing we need is a property to check and see if each type of logging is enabled.&#160; These getters will just reach into our BlogConfig to see if the property above is set to true or false:&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;div class="csharpcode"&gt;    &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   1:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt; IsDbLoggingEnabled&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   2:  &lt;/span&gt;{&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   3:  &lt;/span&gt;     get&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   4:  &lt;/span&gt;     {&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   5:  &lt;/span&gt;          &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; CacheHandler.GetBlogConfig().LogToDb;&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   6:  &lt;/span&gt;     }&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   7:  &lt;/span&gt;}&lt;/pre&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;style type="text/css"&gt;  .csharpcode, .csharpcode pre  {   font-size: small;   color: black;   font-family: consolas, "Courier New", courier, monospace;   background-color: #ffffff;   /*white-space: pre;*/  }  .csharpcode pre { margin: 0em; }  .csharpcode .rem { color: #008000; }  .csharpcode .kwrd { color: #0000ff; }  .csharpcode .str { color: #006080; }  .csharpcode .op { color: #0000c0; }  .csharpcode .preproc { color: #cc6633; }  .csharpcode .asp { background-color: #ffff00; }  .csharpcode .html { color: #800000; }  .csharpcode .attr { color: #ff0000; }  .csharpcode .alt   {   background-color: #f4f4f4;   width: 100%;   margin: 0em;  }  .csharpcode .lnum { color: #606060; }&lt;/style&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;We're going to create two methods for each type of logging.&#160; One that takes in an exception and one that takes in individual details (in case we're not logging a specific exception).&#160; Both of these methods will also take in the "logging source" (the method or file calling the logging method).&#160; Before we create those, we'll create our helper methods to take in those details and create a BlogLog object:&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;div class="csharpcode"&gt;    &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   1:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; BlogLog GetBlogLog(&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;

  2:  &lt;/span&gt;{&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   3:  &lt;/span&gt;    BlogLog log = &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; BlogLog()&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   4:  &lt;/span&gt;    {&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   5:  &lt;/span&gt;        BlogConfigId = CacheHandler.BlogConfigId,&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   6:  &lt;/span&gt;        CreateDate = DateTime.Now,&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   7:  &lt;/span&gt;        EventLevel = level,&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   8:  &lt;/span&gt;        Exception = details,&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   9:  &lt;/span&gt;        Message = message,&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;

     &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  18:  &lt;/span&gt;    BlogLog log = &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; BlogLog()&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  19:  &lt;/span&gt;    {&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  20:  &lt;/span&gt;        BlogConfigId = CacheHandler.BlogConfigId,&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  21:  &lt;/span&gt;

 29:  &lt;/span&gt;}&lt;/pre&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;style type="text/css"&gt;  .csharpcode, .csharpcode pre  {   font-size: small;   color: black;   font-family: consolas, "Courier New", courier, monospace;

It will simply concatenate a few of the details of the exception:&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;div class="csharpcode"&gt;    &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   1:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; GetInfoFromException(Exception ex)&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   2:  &lt;/span&gt;{&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   3:  &lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; stackTrace = ex.StackTrace + &lt;span class="str"&gt;&quot;\n\n&quot;&lt;/span&gt;;&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   4:  &lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (ex.InnerException != &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   5:  &lt;/span&gt;        stackTrace += LoggingHandler.GetInfoFromException(ex.InnerException);&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   6:  &lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; stackTrace;&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   7:  &lt;/span&gt;}&lt;/pre&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;style type="text/css"&gt;  .csharpcode, .csharpcode pre  {   font-size: small;   color: black;   font-family: consolas, "Courier New", courier, monospace;   background-color: #ffffff;   /*white-space: pre;*/  }  .csharpcode pre { margin: 0em; }  .csharpcode .rem { color: #008000;

}&lt;/style&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Finally we'll create our two actual logging methods.&#160; As you'll see, these will both make use of our GetBlogLog methods above:&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;div class="csharpcode"&gt;    &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   1:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; LogToDb(&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; message, &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; details, &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; level, &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; logger)&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   2:  &lt;/span&gt;{&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   3:  &lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (LoggingHandler.IsDbLoggingEnabled)&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   4:  &lt;/span&gt;    {&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   5:  &lt;/span&gt;        BlogLog log = LoggingHandler.GetBlogLog(message, details, level, logger);&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   6:  &lt;/span&gt;&#160;&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   7:  &lt;/span&gt;        var repo = VeritasRepository.GetInstance();&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   8:  &lt;/span&gt;        repo.Add(log);&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   9:  &lt;/span&gt;        repo.Save();&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  10:  &lt;/span&gt;    }&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  11:  &lt;/span&gt;}&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  12:  &lt;/span&gt;&#160;&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  13:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; LogToDb(Exception ex, &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; logger)&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  14:  &lt;/span&gt;{&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  15:  &lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (LoggingHandler.IsDbLoggingEnabled)&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  16:  &lt;/span&gt;    {&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  17:  &lt;/span&gt;        BlogLog log = LoggingHandler.GetBlogLog(ex, logger);&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  18:  &lt;/span&gt;&#160;&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  19:  &lt;/span&gt;        var repo = VeritasRepository.GetInstance();&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  20:  &lt;/span&gt;        repo.Add(log);&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  21:  &lt;/span&gt;        repo.Save();&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  22:  &lt;/span&gt;    }&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  23:  &lt;/span&gt;}&lt;/pre&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;style type="text/css"&gt;  .csharpcode, .csharpcode pre  {   font-size: small;   color: black;   font-family: consolas, "Courier New", courier, monospace;   background-color: #ffffff;   /*white-space: pre;*/  }  .csharpcode pre { margin: 0em; }  .csharpcode .rem { color: #008000;

}&lt;/style&gt;    &lt;p&gt;That's it for logging to the database.&#160; We've got two additional methods that will log to email and log to a file but we won't show those for brevity's sake.&#160; If you want, you can check out the code attached to see what those look like.&#160; We're now able to log any errors or information we might want to from anywhere else in the code and we can do it in several different ways.&#160; However, we need a method that will handle figuring out where and what to log to so we don't have to pick and choose in other locations:&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;div class="csharpcode"&gt;    &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   1:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; Log(&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; message, &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; details, &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; level, &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; logger)&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   2:  &lt;/span&gt;{&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   3:  &lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (LoggingHandler.IsDbLoggingEnabled)&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   4:  &lt;/span&gt;        LogToDb(message, details, level, logger);&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   5:  &lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (LoggingHandler.IsEmailLoggingEnabled)&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   6:  &lt;/span&gt;        LogToEmail(message, details, level, logger);&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   7:  &lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (LoggingHandler.IsFileLoggingEnabled)&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   8:  &lt;/span&gt;        LogToFile(message, details, level, logger);&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   9:  &lt;/span&gt;}&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  10:  &lt;/span&gt;&#160;&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  11:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; Log(Exception ex, &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; logger)&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  12:  &lt;/span&gt;{&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  13:  &lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (LoggingHandler.IsDbLoggingEnabled)&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;

     &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  16:  &lt;/span&gt;        LogToEmail(ex, logger);&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  17:  &lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (LoggingHandler.IsFileLoggingEnabled)&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  18:  &lt;/span&gt;        LogToFile(ex, logger);&lt;/pre&gt;      &lt;pre class="alt"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  19:  &lt;/span&gt;}&lt;/pre&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;style type="text/css"&gt;  .csharpcode, .csharpcode pre  {   font-size: small;   color: black;   font-family: consolas, "Courier New", courier, monospace;

You may notice that they're missing tests for the email logging.&#160; I haven't decided on the best way to handle those yet so they aren't there.&#160; </content:encoded><dsq:thread_identifier>Veritas---Error-Logging---Part-8</dsq:thread_identifier><wp:post_date_gmt>2010-08-19 02:00:00.000</wp:post_date_gmt><wp:comment_status>open</wp:comment_status><wp:comment><dsq:remote><dsq:id>4</dsq:id><dsq:avatar/></dsq:remote><wp:comment_id>172</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Chris</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>chris@chrisrisner.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://chrisrisner.com</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>12.165.188.130</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2010-08-24 12:31:31.817</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content>I didn't need anything that complex and didn't want to mess with the configuration (I know that's not a great excuse but it is an excuse).</wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment></item>

Outside of just getting our order, I don't think he said more than two words to us the entire evening.&#160; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It gave me the impression that as we appeared younger than the people around us, he just didn't care about our level of service.&#160; Finally, the thing that really put a black spot on my evening, and did the most to lessen my chances of returning, he picked up our bill before we had even walked out of the restaurant.&#160; Not only did he pick it up while we were putting our coats on at the table, he opened it to look at the tip we gave him.&#160; He might as well have just said &quot;you look like cheap jerks&quot;.&#160; Even after the previous issues, we still left him an over 15% tip.&#160; In hindsight, he deserved much less.&#160; While I will stress again that the food was wonderful, the level of service was extremely poor, and is something I will definitely consider before returning to a Muer restaurant in the future. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A few days later I submitted my comments regarding our evening to Big Fish's "Guest Comments" on their web site.&#160; 4 days later I received a response from William at Landry's Restaurants.&#160; Landry's purchased Big Fish from the Muer restaurant group sometime after Charley Muer was lost at sea.&#160; Instead of actually commenting in ANY WAY on my issue, the email was a canned response asking for my phone number so we could speak in person.&#160; 3 days later, on February 22nd, I replied with my phone number.&#160; As of this post (March 25th), I have still not heard from anyone at Landry's via phone or email.&#160; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The worst part about this whole affair is that the food was really good.&#160; However, with the service we received and the shoddy attempt at doing anything to correct it by Landry's, I don't think I can see myself ever returning to Big Fish or EVER visiting a Landry's restaurant in the future.&#160; I even went so far as to &lt;a title="Big Fish on Yelp" href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/big-fish-dearborn" target="_blank"&gt;share these thoughts on Yelp&lt;/a&gt;.&#160; This is a perfect example of a situation that &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; have been fixed with minimal effort but was botched so horribly, it's irrevocably left a mark on me.&#160; Oh well, not it's like I like &lt;a title="Going Out To Eat" href="http://chrisrisner.com/Detroit-Restaurant-Week-2010" target="_blank"&gt;going out to eat or doing anything food related&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><dsq:thread_identifier>Landry's-and-Big-Fish-serves-up-Bad-Service</dsq:thread_identifier><wp:post_date_gmt>2010-03-25 23:55:00.000</wp:post_date_gmt><wp:comment_status>open</wp:comment_status><wp:comment><dsq:remote><dsq:id>46</dsq:id><dsq:avatar/></dsq:remote><wp:comment_id>186</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Kyle Blair</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>kbindbn@gmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>69.14.93.145</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2011-02-16 11:29:06.577</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content>Wow. I can't believe it took me over a year to stumble upon this. A friend of mine pointed this out to me - as well as your comments on Yelp.     Firstly, I'd like to invite you back to Big Fish. I am a professional server and am very good at my job. I have been waiting tables in a casual fine dining setting for 10 years and am confident in my ability.   You must understand that on holiday's like Valentine's Day, the restaurant industry is inundated with people who are inexperienced diners. On such occasions we, as servers, are met with a rising expectation of perfect service for less compensation. I could spout stereotypical comments - but I digress. There are many reasons your dining experience failed - but the main focus here is on perception.  Your perception of the situation, sadly is all that truly matters. You perceived me as aloof. You perceived me as disinterested.  The only thing I can do in this situation is try to make you understand that there is always two sides to every story.   The reason I was likely aloof with you is b/c you were A) a couple - on a date and most people in that situation want the company of their significant other, not some homo trying to cock block their girl friend, B) it was Valentine's Day - I was likely very busy, and C) I have no idea what you look like - but I  should add that I am, at times,  intimidated by a lot of overtly str8 men. I'm gay. I get uncomfortable sometimes, period. This is especially true if you have a nice lady with you. At times I try to remain distant in order to prevent giving the impression that I'm being overly friendly to you or your cohort. I don't want to make anybody feel uncomfortable - let's face it - people still have issues w/ the whole 'gay' bit and I try to avoid that at all costs.   Now don't get me wrong. I'm not playing a 'gay' card so that you'll suddenly change your pace - I'm simply trying to give you a better understanding toward the experience you had.   Lastly - I'd like to address your comment about picking up the check before you left. This is a very common practice, especially considering the volume of business on holiday and the fact that most of the clientele is new and unfamiliar.  The reason I took your check immediately is to insure that you not only paid your bill w/ cash or a credit card but that you also signed a copy of the receipt and LEFT IT IN THE BOOK FOR ME! If you accidentally forget to sign the credit card receipt or don't leave it, I'm screwed, and it's my fault - b/c I didn't check before you left. My checking the book has nothing to do with me looking for your tip. Regardless of when I see it - when you're there in the dining room or 10 hours after you've left - it will remain the same. I know this. By looking at what you've left BEFORE you leave the restaurant I am positive that I have all the necessary implements to complete my job for the evening. After all - this is my job.     So anyway - I hope you have a better understanding as to what REALLY happened that day.     In life - I'm very friendly and kind. I'm well mannered and educated. I am polite and caring. I again, invite you, and challenge you to come back and see me at The Big Fish. I'd love nothing more than to show you and exceedingly good time.

<item><title>re: Landry's and Big Fish serves up Bad Service</title><link>http://chrisrisner.com/Landry's-and-Big-Fish-serves-up-Bad-Service</link><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a onclick="return hs.expand(this)" class="highslide" href="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/634051460845486906.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="border-right-width: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="BigFish" border="0" alt="BigFish" align="right" src="http://chrisrisner.com/upload/634051460845486906.jpg" width="244" height="244" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; For Valentine's day this year, I decided to take Erin out to Big Fish in Dearborn.&#160; While it's been several years since I've been able to make it to Big Fish, I've tried to get to a Muer restaurant (be in Meriweather's, Gandy Dancer, or any of the affiliated Muer restaurants (Rocky's, Kruse and Muer)) as often as possible.&#160; The quality of food and service at the Muer restaurants is some of the best to be had in metro Detroit, or so I thought.&#160; After a fair amount of build up, I can happily say that neither of us were disappointed when it came to the food at Big Fish.&#160; Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for our service.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Our server for the evening, Kyle B, was less than satisfactory.&#160; To begin with, he took an exceedingly long time between his visits to our table when we first arrived.&#160; Secondly, he seemed much more interested in taking care of the other tables around us.&#160; At one point, he was just about to set our bread basket down at our table, literally a foot away from doing so, when he looked at another table, turned around and set it back on his tray so that he could go to their table and make sure everything looked alright.&#160; In addition, he seemed to be attempting to make friendly conversation and build a rapport with the guests sitting around us, however, he wasted no such time on us.&#160; He went so far as to talk about the Friends Dining Club with one couple and talked to another couple at length about travelling.&#160; Not only was he not friendly, he seemed to be very aloof. Outside of just getting our order, I don't think he said more than two words to us the entire evening.&#160; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It gave me the impression that as we appeared younger than the people around us, he just didn't care about our level of service.&#160; Finally, the thing that really put a black spot on my evening, and did the most to lessen my chances of returning, he picked up our bill before we had even walked out of the restaurant.&#160; Not only did he pick it up while we were putting our coats on at the table, he opened it to look at the tip we gave him.&#160; He might as well have just said &quot;you look like cheap jerks&quot;.&#160; Even after the previous issues, we still left him an over 15% tip.&#160; In hindsight, he deserved much less.&#160; While I will stress again that the food was wonderful, the level of service was extremely poor, and is something I will definitely consider before returning to a Muer restaurant in the future. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A few days later I submitted my comments regarding our evening to Big Fish's "Guest Comments" on their web site.&#160; 4 days later I received a response from William at Landry's Restaurants.&#160; Landry's purchased Big Fish from the Muer restaurant group sometime after Charley Muer was lost at sea.&#160; Instead of actually commenting in ANY WAY on my issue, the email was a canned response asking for my phone number so we could speak in person.&#160; 3 days later, on February 22nd, I replied with my phone number.&#160; As of this post (March 25th), I have still not heard from anyone at Landry's via phone or email.&#160; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The worst part about this whole affair is that the food was really good.&#160; However, with the service we received and the shoddy attempt at doing anything to correct it by Landry's, I don't think I can see myself ever returning to Big Fish or EVER visiting a Landry's restaurant in the future.&#160; I even went so far as to &lt;a title="Big Fish on Yelp" href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/big-fish-dearborn" target="_blank"&gt;share these thoughts on Yelp&lt;/a&gt;.&#160; This is a perfect example of a situation that &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; have been fixed with minimal effort but was botched so horribly, it's irrevocably left a mark on me.&#160; Oh well, not it's like I like &lt;a title="Going Out To Eat" href="http://chrisrisner.com/Detroit-Restaurant-Week-2010" target="_blank"&gt;going out to eat or doing anything food related&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><dsq:thread_identifier>Landry's-and-Big-Fish-serves-up-Bad-Service</dsq:thread_identifier><wp:post_date_gmt>2010-03-25 23:55:00.000</wp:post_date_gmt><wp:comment_status>open</wp:comment_status><wp:comment><dsq:remote><dsq:id>4</dsq:id><dsq:avatar/></dsq:remote><wp:comment_id>187</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Chris</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>chris@chrisrisner.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://chrisrisner.com</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>24.33.241.24</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2011-02-28 21:25:10.290</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content>Kyle,    I'm extremely happy you took the time to reply here.  I understand that many people are inexperienced diners and you, as a waiter, suffer because of that.  While my fiancee and I would like to come back, your comment didn't really make me feel like you felt any of our concerns were valid.  Instead of taking any accountability for why our experience was this way, I feel like you made excuses and shifted blame.  Furthermore, you haven't really said how anything would be any different if we return again.  I appreciate your comments but it hasn't changed my feelings about our experience.    Also, I've changed your email address from your comment so it's not the exact email address.  Spammers will scan websites looking for email addresses so they can spam you.

<item><title>re: Detroit Restaurant Week: My First Android App</title><link>http://chrisrisner.com/Detroit-Restaurant-Week--My-First-Android-App</link><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title="DRW Android" href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.restaurantweek.activities"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; display: inline; float: right" align="right" src="https://ssl.gstatic.com/android/market/com.restaurantweek.activities/ss-1-320-480-160-0-284a23cd9f5d914a55bd9708bd068639e5894628" width="144" height="240" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a title="DRW Android" href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.restaurantweek.activities"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; display: inline; float: left" align="left" src="https://ssl.gstatic.com/android/market/com.restaurantweek.activities/ss-0-320-480-160-0-b757e5843191dbe157fd333f13db27586f701c36" width="144" height="240" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This past weekend I published my first application to the Android Marketplace: &lt;a title="Detroit Restaurant Week" href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.restaurantweek.activities"&gt;Detroit Restaurant Week&lt;/a&gt;.&#160; DRW is a android application front end for the &lt;a title="Detroit Restaurant Week Event" href="http://www.detroitrestaurantweek.com/"&gt;Restaurant Week event&lt;/a&gt; taking place this coming April.&#160; Essentially it makes it easier to view the restaurants participating, view their menus, make reservations, check reviews on Yelp, and more.&#160; Erin and I really like &lt;a title="Past Restaurant Week" href="http://chrisrisner.com/Detroit-Restaurant-Week-2010-%E2%80%93-Postmortem"&gt;visiting fine dining establishments&lt;/a&gt;, as I've talked about before, so the restaurant week is something we really enjoy.&#160; I've wanted to get into Android development for a while and thought this would be a great way to make a fairly simple application that might actually be useful.&#160; I got the idea when I was watching a video from 2010's Google IO event.&#160; The session was a &lt;a title="Beginner&#39;s Guide TO Android" href="http://www.google.com/events/io/2010/sessions/beginners-guide-android.html"&gt;basic introduction to Android&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a title="Reto meier" href="http://twitter.com/retomeier"&gt;Reto Meier&lt;/a&gt;.&#160; In the presentation, Reto talks about sharing and consuming.&#160; Specifically, he talks about the Where and OpenTable applications and how Where launches OpenTable using an intent.&#160; For those of you that aren't in the know, intents is a methodology in the Android OS where one application can say "if someone wants to do X, I can handle X for them".&#160; So when you install OpenTable it tells the OS, "if someone wants to make a reservation, I can make that reservation". The Where app then checks to see if something can handle the reservation intent (i.e. if OpenTable is installed) and if so, it tells the OS that it wants to make a reservation.&#160; So for my app, I wanted to do the same thing.&#160; Thankfully, they &lt;a title="Using Intents for OpenTable" href="http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2009/11/integrating-application-with-intents.html"&gt;posted some of the implementation details for calling the OpenTable intent&lt;/a&gt;.&#160; Unfortunately, they don't explain everything and there doesn't seem to be any documentation on the internet to cover all aspects of calling the intent.&#160; The basics of it were easy to accomplish.&#160; However, I still haven't figured out how to specify the date I want the reservation to be preset to when OpenTable opens.&#160; I ran into a similar problem when opening a calendar entry when someone clicks "Add to Calendar".&#160; I wanted to put the restaurant's address into the Where field for the calendar entry but haven't found out how to do that yet.&#160; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;After showing this app off to a few people, everyone seemed to think it was pretty cool.&#160; I already have a few things I'm planning to implement in the next few weeks (i.e. changing the restaurant Address and "Add to Calendar" to look like the blue, underlined, clickable links like the Phone and View Web Page).&#160; One thing that did come out of publishing this was several people saying "Could you make this for Chicago's restaurant week" or "Could you make this for Indianapolis?"&#160; Thankfully, I made this application so it would be very easy for me to redo it for a different city.&#160; However, if I did that, it would mean a different app for each city.&#160; I'm thinking instead that I might make a single "Restaurant Week" app that allows you to pick out what event you want to see the information on.&#160; So instead of one app per city, you'd go in to the single app and choose which city's Restaurant Week info you want to see.&#160; &lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;When I get some time I'm going to talk about some of the challenges I ran into while making this app and learning to program for Android.&#160; I'm also going to talk about some of the differences between developing for Android (which I'm doing at home) and developing for the iPhone (which I'm doing at work).&#160; For now, if you have an Android, go &lt;a title="Grab my Android App" href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.restaurantweek.activities"&gt;grab my app&lt;/a&gt; and let me know what you think.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><dsq:thread_identifier>Detroit-Restaurant-Week--My-First-Android-App</dsq:thread_identifier><wp:post_date_gmt>2011-03-20 23:32:00.000</wp:post_date_gmt><wp:comment_status>open</wp:comment_status><wp:comment><dsq:remote><dsq:id>12</dsq:id><dsq:avatar/></dsq:remote><wp:comment_id>188</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>AtomicInternet</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>atomicinternet@gmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://atomicinternet.homeip.net</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>24.145.221.93</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2011-03-27 18:00:35.080</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content>Now to port it to WinPhone7!</wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment></item>
