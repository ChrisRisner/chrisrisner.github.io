## Who am I?

My name is Chris Risner.  It would be kind of weird if it wasn't.  Right?

I've been involved in computer software development on a professional level since 2005.  Though I've been into computers and
technology since my parents brought home our first Intellivision and Apple IIGS.  I knew all the way back then that
I wanted to work with computers.  

Like many growing up around then, I thought for sure it would be making games.  I did spend a good amount of time,
especially in college, working towards that but it didn't end up happening (and I'm happier for it).    

## What do I do?

I am a Technical Evangelist at Microsoft in Redmond, WA.  There most of my focus is on how Microsoft can work best with non-Microsoft
technology.  A lot of that has to do with helping make sure [Azure](http://azure.microsoft.com) can be used by everyone,
no matter what programming language they're using and what platform they want to run on!

## What do I do for fun?

When I'm not working on work, I'm working on my own development projects.  When I actually put the computer away,
I spend time with my dog in the Pacific Northwest boating, eating, and doing other fun things.
